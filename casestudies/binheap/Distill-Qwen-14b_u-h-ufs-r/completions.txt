Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. The repOK method should check all the invariants that define the correct state of the heap. Let me think about what properties a Binomial Heap must satisfy.

First, I remember that a Binomial Heap is a collection of Binomial Trees. Each tree must satisfy the heap property, meaning a parent node's key is less than or equal to its children's keys. Also, each Binomial Tree in the heap has a degree equal to the number of its children, and the structure must follow the rules of a Binomial Heap, where for each degree d, there are at most two Binomial Trees.

So, the repOK method should verify these properties.

Let me look at the BinomialHeap class. It has a Nodes field which is the root of the Binomial Trees. The size is the number of nodes in the heap.

First, I need to check that the size is correct. The size should be equal to the sum of the sizes of all the Binomial Trees. So, I can get the size from the Nodes and compare it with the class's size variable.

Wait, the BinomialHeapNode has a size() method that returns 1 plus the size of its child and sibling. So, if I traverse all the roots and sum their sizes, it should equal the heap's size.

Next, each Binomial Tree must be a valid heap. That means for every node, its key is less than or equal to its children's keys. I need to check this for all nodes in the heap.

Also, each Binomial Tree must have a degree that follows the rule: for any two trees of the same degree, one must be connected as a child of the other. So, I need to ensure that the structure doesn't have more than two trees of the same degree.

Wait, but how do I check that? Maybe I can collect all the roots and their degrees, then count how many roots have the same degree. For each degree, there should be at most two roots with that degree.

Additionally, I should check that the parent and child relationships are correct. For example, a node's parent should have a key less than or equal to the node's key.

Let me outline the steps the repOK method should perform:

1. Check that the size of the heap is correct by comparing it with the sum of the sizes of all the Binomial Trees.

2. Ensure that each Binomial Tree is a valid heap, i.e., the parent's key is <= children's keys.

3. Verify that the structure of the Binomial Heap is correct: for each degree, there are at most two roots with that degree.

4. Check that the parent and child relationships are valid, meaning each node's parent has a key <= its own key.

5. Ensure that all nodes are part of the correct structure, i.e., they are either roots or part of the tree structure.

Let me think about how to implement each of these.

For step 1: I can traverse all the roots (each root is a sibling of the main Nodes), sum their sizes, and compare with the heap's size.

Wait, the BinomialHeap has a Nodes field which is the root of the structure. But in a Binomial Heap, the structure is a collection of trees, each of which is a root. So, the Nodes field is the first root, and the other roots are connected via siblings. So, to get all the roots, I can start from Nodes and follow the siblings until I reach null.

So, I can collect all the roots by traversing the Nodes and their siblings.

Once I have all the roots, I can sum their size() and check if it equals the heap's size.

For step 2: For each node, I need to check that its key is less than or equal to its children's keys. This can be done recursively for each node.

For step 3: I need to collect the degrees of all the roots and ensure that for each degree, there are at most two roots with that degree.

For step 4: For each node, check that its parent's key is <= its key. But wait, in a Binomial Heap, the parent's key is always <= the child's key because of the heap property. So, this is already covered in step 2.

Wait, no. Step 2 checks the heap property for each node's children, but step 4 is about the parent's key being <= the node's key. So, perhaps I need to check that for each node, its parent's key is <= its key.

But in the BinomialHeapNode, the parent is set correctly during insert and extract operations. So, I need to ensure that for every node except the roots, their parent's key is <= their key.

Wait, no. The heap property is that a parent's key is <= children's keys. So, for each node, its key should be >= its parent's key. So, for every node, if it has a parent, then node.key >= parent.key.

So, I need to check this for all nodes.

How can I traverse all nodes? I can perform a traversal starting from each root and visit all nodes in each tree.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check that the size is correct.
- Check that each node's key is >= its parent's key.
- Check that each tree is a valid heap (i.e., parent keys are <= child keys).
- Check that the structure of the heap is correct (each degree has at most two roots).

Wait, but the structure check is about the degrees of the roots. So, for all roots, their degrees should not have more than two roots with the same degree.

So, I can collect all the degrees of the roots and count how many times each degree appears. For each degree, the count should be <= 2.

Now, let me think about how to implement each part.

First, check the size:

- Traverse all roots (Nodes and its siblings) and sum their size().

- Compare the sum with the heap's size variable.

If they are not equal, return false.

Second, check that each node's key is >= its parent's key.

- For each node, if it has a parent, check that node.key >= parent.key.

- How to traverse all nodes? Maybe perform a BFS or DFS starting from each root.

Third, check the structure: for each degree, at most two roots have that degree.

- Collect all the degrees of the roots.

- Use a map to count the occurrences of each degree.

- For each degree in the map, if the count is more than two, return false.

Fourth, check that each tree is a valid heap.

Wait, isn't that covered by the parent key <= child key? Because for each node, its key is <= its children's keys. So, if I check that for every node, its key is <= its children's keys, that would ensure the heap property.

Wait, no. Because in the BinomialHeap, each tree is a Binomial Tree, which is a heap-ordered tree. So, for each node, its key must be <= its children's keys.

So, for each node, check that its key is <= its children's keys.

So, for each node, if it has a child, then node.key <= child.key.

Wait, no. Wait, in a min-heap, the parent is <= children. So, for a Binomial Heap, which is a min-heap, each parent's key is <= its children's keys.

So, for each node, if it has a child, node.key <= child.key.

So, I need to check this for all nodes.

So, the steps are:

1. Check that the sum of the sizes of all roots equals the heap's size.

2. For each node, if it has a parent, node.key >= parent.key.

3. For each node, if it has children, node.key <= child.key.

4. For all roots, their degrees must have at most two roots with the same degree.

Wait, but step 2 is redundant because step 3 ensures that parents are <= children, which implies that each node's key is >= its parent's key.

Wait, no. Because step 3 checks that each node's key is <= its children's keys. So, for a node, its key is <= its children's keys, which means the children's keys are >= the node's key. So, the parent's key is <= the child's key, which implies that the child's key >= parent's key. So, step 3 already ensures that each node's key is <= its children's keys, which in turn ensures that the parent's key is <= the child's key.

So, perhaps step 2 is redundant because it's already covered by step 3.

Wait, no. Because step 3 is about each node's key being <= its children's keys. So, for the parent node, its key is <= child's key. So, the child's key is >= parent's key. So, for the child node, its parent's key is <= its own key. So, step 3 ensures that for every node, its parent's key is <= its key.

So, step 2 is redundant because it's already covered by step 3.

So, perhaps I can skip step 2.

But to be thorough, maybe I should include it.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is sufficient.

Hmm.

Now, let me think about how to implement each part.

First, the size check:

- Traverse all roots and sum their sizes.

How to get all roots:

Start with the Nodes field. Then, follow the sibling links until null.

For each root in this list, add its size() to a total. Compare total with the heap's size.

If they are not equal, return false.

Second, check that each node's key is <= its children's keys.

This can be done recursively for each node.

For each node, if it has a child, check that node.key <= child.key. Then, recursively check the child.

Third, check the structure: for each degree, at most two roots have that degree.

Collect all the degrees of the roots.

Use a map to count how many roots have each degree.

For each entry in the map, if the count is more than two, return false.

Fourth, check that each node's parent's key is <= its key.

Wait, but this is already covered by step 3, because for each node, its parent's key is <= its key.

So, perhaps step 4 is redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 ensures that for each node, its key is <= its children's keys, which implies that the parent's key is <= the node's key.

So, step 3 covers the parent's key <= node's key.

So, perhaps I don't need to check step 4 separately.

So, the main steps are:

- Check size consistency.

- Check heap property for all nodes.

- Check that the structure has at most two roots per degree.

Now, let's think about how to implement each part.

Implementing size check:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check size
    int total = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        total += current.size();
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    if (total != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check heap property for all nodes
    // For each node, if it has a child, node.key <= child.key
    // Also, for each node, if it has a parent, node.key >= parent.key
    // But the first part is sufficient because it ensures the heap property.

    // Check heap property
    if (!isHeapOrdered()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check structure: each degree has at most two roots
    if (!structureOK()) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Now, implement isHeapOrdered():

private boolean isHeapOrdered() {
    return isHeapOrdered(Nodes);
}

private boolean isHeapOrdered(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.child != null) {
        if (node.key > node.child.key) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!isHeapOrdered(node.child)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (node.sibling != null) {
        return isHeapOrdered(node.sibling);
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, no. Because node.sibling is part of the same root level. So, the heap property doesn't require anything between siblings. Only parent and children.

So, the above function is correct.

Now, implement structureOK():

private boolean structureOK() {
    Map<Integer, Integer> degreeCount = new HashMap<>();
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        int degree = current.degree;
        degreeCount.put(degree, degreeCount.getOrDefault(degree, 0) + 1);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    for (int degree : degreeCount.keySet()) {
        if (degreeCount.get(degree) > 2) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but in a Binomial Heap, the structure is such that for any two roots with the same degree, one must be connected as a child of the other. So, the count per degree should be at most two.

So, the above code correctly checks that.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would perform these checks.

Wait, but what about the case where the heap is empty? If Nodes is null, then size should be 0.

So, in the size check, if Nodes is null, total is 0, which should equal size.

So, that's handled.

Another edge case: when there's only one node. Then, Nodes is that node, size is 1, and the structure is correct.

Another case: when two roots have the same degree. That's allowed.

What about when three roots have the same degree? That's invalid.

So, the structureOK method correctly returns false in that case.

Now, let me think about the isHeapOrdered method. It checks for each node that its key is <= its child's key, and recursively checks the child. But what about the siblings? For example, in the same tree, a node's sibling might have a smaller key, but that's allowed because they are siblings, not parent and child.

So, the isHeapOrdered method correctly only checks the parent-child relationships.

Wait, but in the BinomialHeapNode, the child is the first child, and the siblings are connected via the sibling link. So, the function correctly traverses all nodes in all trees.

So, the repOK method should include these checks.

Now, let me write the code.

First, the repOK method:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check size consistency
    int total = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        total += current.size();
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    if (total != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check heap property
    if (!isHeapOrdered()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check structure: at most two roots per degree
    if (!structureOK()) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Then, implement isHeapOrdered:

private boolean isHeapOrdered(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.child != null) {
        if (node.key > node.child.key) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!isHeapOrdered(node.child)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (node.sibling != null) {
        return isHeapOrdered(node.sibling);
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but this will traverse all nodes, including siblings. But the heap property doesn't require anything between siblings. So, the function is correct.

Wait, no. Because for a node's sibling, the function will check if the sibling's key is <= its own key, but that's not necessary. Because in a Binomial Heap, siblings can have any order as long as their parent's key is <= theirs.

Wait, no. The heap property only requires that a parent's key is <= its children's keys. It doesn't impose any order between siblings.

So, the isHeapOrdered function is correct because it only checks the parent-child relationships.

Wait, but in the function above, for a node, it checks its child, and then recursively checks the child. Then, it checks the sibling, and recursively checks the sibling. But the sibling's children are handled in their own recursion.

So, the function correctly ensures that every node's key is <= its children's keys.

Now, the structureOK function:

private boolean structureOK() {
    Map<Integer, Integer> degreeCount = new HashMap<>();
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        int degree = current.degree;
        degreeCount.put(degree, degreeCount.getOrDefault(degree, 0) + 1);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    for (int degree : degreeCount.keySet()) {
        if (degreeCount.get(degree) > 2) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

This correctly counts the number of roots per degree and ensures no more than two.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should include these checks.

Wait, but what about the case where the heap is empty? If Nodes is null, then the size is 0, and the other checks are not performed. That's correct.

Another edge case: when the heap has only one node. Then, the size is 1, the structure is correct (degree 0, count 1), and the heap property is satisfied.

Another case: when two roots have the same degree. That's allowed, so structureOK returns true.

If three roots have the same degree, structureOK returns false.

So, the repOK method should correctly validate the heap.

I think this covers all the necessary checks.
</think>

To write the representation invariant for the `BinomialHeap` class, we need to ensure that the object maintains the properties of a valid Binomial Heap. The `repOK` method will check the following:

1. **Size Consistency**: The sum of the sizes of all Binomial Trees (roots) must equal the heap's size.
2. **Heap Property**: Each node's key must be less than or equal to its children's keys.
3. **Structure Property**: For each degree, there can be at most two roots in the heap.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check size consistency
    int total = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        total += current.size();
        current = current.sibling;
