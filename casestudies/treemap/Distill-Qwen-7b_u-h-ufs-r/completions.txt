Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the TreeMap class in Java. The representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the structure of the TreeMap class. It's a balanced binary search tree (BST) with each node having a color (red or black), a key, a value, pointers to left and right children, and a parent. The tree maintains the BST property based on the comparator, and it's a red-black tree implementation.

I remember that in a red-black tree, each node must satisfy certain properties. Let me list them:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. All leaves (null nodes) are considered black.
4. No red node has a red child.
5. Every path from a node to any of its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.

So, I need to translate these properties into code.

First, I'll check if all nodes are either red or black. The root must be black. Also, any null children should be treated as black. Wait, in the code, the root is initialized as black, so that's covered.

Next, I'll need to traverse the tree to check each node's color and ensure no red node has a red child. Also, I'll need to count the number of black nodes along each path from the root to the leaves to ensure they are the same.

But wait, traversing the entire tree might be time-consuming, but for the representation invariant, it's necessary to ensure correctness.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

1. Check if the root is null. If it's null, the tree is empty, which is valid only if size is zero.
2. Check if the root is black. If not, the tree is invalid.
3. For each node, check that both children are null or have valid colors.
4. For each node, ensure that if a child is red, the other child (if exists) is black.
5. Traverse each path from root to leaves, counting the number of black nodes, and ensure all paths have the same count.

Wait, but counting the number of black nodes on each path might be complex. Alternatively, during traversal, I can keep track of the current count of black nodes and compare it with the expected count from the root.

Alternatively, I can perform a helper method that counts the number of black nodes along a path and ensures consistency.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to traverse each path and count the number of black nodes, then compare all counts.

Let me outline the code:

- Check if root is null and size is zero: valid.
- Check if root is null and size is not zero: invalid.
- Check if root is black: if not, invalid.
- For each node, check that if it's red, both children are not red.
- Traverse each path from root to leaves, counting black nodes, and ensure all counts are equal.

Wait, but how do I traverse each path? I can write a helper method that recursively traverses each path and counts the black nodes. Then, I can store the counts in a set and check if all are the same.

Alternatively, during traversal, I can keep track of the current count and compare it with the expected count from the root.

But perhaps it's easier to collect all counts and then check for consistency.

So, the repOK method would:

- If size is zero, root must be null.
- If size is not zero, root must be black.
- For each node, ensure that if it's red, both children are not red.
- Traverse each path from root to leaves, count the number of black nodes, and ensure all counts are equal.

Now, let's think about how to implement this in Java.

First, check if root is null and size is zero: return true.

If root is null and size is not zero: return false.

If root is not black: return false.

Then, for each node, check that if it's red, both children are not red.

To do this, I can write a helper method that traverses the tree and checks this condition.

Next, traverse each path to count black nodes. I can write another helper method that recursively traverses the tree and counts black nodes from the current node down to the leaves.

Wait, but the root is black, so the count starts at 1. Then, for each path, the count should be the same.

Alternatively, I can perform a depth-first traversal, counting black nodes, and store each count in a set. Then, check if all counts are equal.

But this might be computationally expensive for large trees, but for the purpose of the representation invariant, it's necessary for correctness.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would:

1. Check if root is null and size is zero: valid.
2. Check if root is null and size is not zero: invalid.
3. Check if root is black: if not, invalid.
4. For each node, ensure that if it's red, both children are not red.
5. Traverse each path from root to leaves, count the number of black nodes, and ensure all counts are the same.

Now, let's translate this into code.

First, the root check:

if (root == null) {
    if (size == 0) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}

if (!root.isBlack()) {
    return false;
}

Then, check each node for red children:

private void checkNodeColors(Node node) {
    if (node == null) return;
    if (node.isRed()) {
        if (node.left != null && node.left.isRed()) {
            return false;
        }
        if (node.right != null && node.right.isRed()) {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

Then, traverse each path to count black nodes:

private int countBlackFrom(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    int count = 0;
    if (node.isBlack()) {
        count++;
    }
    count += countBlackFrom(node.left);
    count += countBlackFrom(node.right);
    return count;
}

Wait, but this counts all black nodes, including leaves. But in a red-black tree, the leaves are considered black, so this should be correct.

But I need to ensure that all paths have the same number of black nodes. So, I can collect all counts and check for equality.

But how to collect all counts? I can use a Set<Integer> and add each count, then check if the size of the set is 1.

So, in the repOK method:

Set<Integer> counts = new HashSet<>();
int rootCount = countBlackFrom(root);
counts.add(rootCount);

// Now traverse all other paths
// Wait, but how to traverse all paths? Maybe using a helper that traverses each path.

Alternatively, I can write a helper that traverses each path and adds the counts.

But perhaps a better approach is to write a helper that traverses each node and ensures that the count from the root to that node is consistent.

Wait, maybe I can perform a traversal where I keep track of the current count and compare it to the expected count.

Alternatively, I can perform a traversal where I pass the expected count and ensure that each path meets it.

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, I can collect all counts and then check if they are all the same.

So, in the repOK method:

Set<Integer> counts = new HashSet<>();
// Add root count
counts.add(countBlackFrom(root));

// Now traverse all other nodes and collect their counts
// Wait, but how to collect counts from all paths?

Alternatively, I can perform a traversal where I pass the current count and ensure that each path meets the required count.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to perform a traversal where I keep track of the number of black nodes from the root to the current node, and ensure that it matches the expected count.

But I'm not sure how to implement this.
