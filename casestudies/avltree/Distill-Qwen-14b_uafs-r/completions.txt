Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Hmm, what's a representation invariant? Oh right, it's a condition that must always hold true for the data structure's representation. So, for an AVL tree, the invariant is that every node's left and right subtrees have heights that differ by at most one.

First, I should think about the structure of the AvlTree class. It has a root node, and each node has left and right children, along with a height. The balance is maintained through rotations and other operations.

So, the repOK method should check that for every node in the tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees differ by no more than one. Also, I should ensure that the tree is properly structured, like nodes aren't null where they shouldn't be, and the height is correctly calculated.

Wait, how do I traverse the tree? Maybe a helper method that recursively checks each node. For each node, I'll get the heights of the left and right children. Then, I'll check if their difference is within the allowed imbalance, which is 1 in this case.

I also need to make sure that the height of each node is correctly updated. So, for each node, its height should be one more than the maximum of its children's heights.

What about the base cases? If a node is null, its height is -1, right? So, when checking a node's left or right child, if it's null, the height is -1.

I should also check that the tree isn't corrupted, like cycles in the links. Oh, but that might be more complicated. Maybe for simplicity, I can just check the height condition and the structure of the tree.

Wait, in the given code, the AvlNode has a height field. So, when inserting or removing, the balance method updates the heights. So, in repOK, I can assume that the heights are correctly maintained, but I should still verify that each node's height is indeed one more than the max of its children's heights.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will:

1. If the tree is empty (root is null), return true.
2. Otherwise, traverse each node, checking for each node:
   a. The left and right children's heights differ by at most 1.
   b. The node's height is one more than the maximum of its children's heights.
3. Also, ensure that the tree doesn't have any inconsistencies, like a node pointing to itself or forming a cycle.

Wait, checking for cycles might be tricky. Maybe for now, I'll focus on the height conditions, as they are the core of the AVL tree invariant.

So, I'll write a helper method that takes a node and returns true if the subtree rooted at that node satisfies the AVL conditions. For each node, I'll check the left and right children's heights, then the node's height.

I should also make sure that the helper method handles null nodes correctly, returning true since they don't violate the invariant.

Putting this into code, the repOK method will call this helper on the root. If any node fails the checks, repOK returns false; otherwise, true.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

To write a representation invariant for the `AvlTree` class, we need to ensure that the AVL tree properties are maintained. Specifically, for every node in the tree, the heights of its left and right subtrees can differ by at most one. Additionally, the tree must be properly structured, with valid node links and correct height values.

### Approach
The representation invariant for the `AvlTree` class will be implemented as a method `repOK()` that checks the following conditions:
1. **Height Balance**: For every node, the heights of its left and right subtrees must differ by at most one.
2. **Height Calculation**: The height of each node must be one more than the maximum height of its left and right children.
3. **Tree Structure**: The tree must not contain any cycles or invalid node links.

The method will traverse the tree recursively, checking each node to ensure these conditions are met. If any condition is violated, the method returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return checkInvariant(root);
}

private boolean checkInvariant(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);

    // Check height balance condition
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the node's height is correctly calculated
    int maxHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != maxHeight + 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return checkInvariant(node.left) && checkInvariant(node.right);
}

private int height(AvlNode node) {
    return node == null ? -1 : node.height;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Height Balance Check**: For each node, the method calculates the heights of its left and right subtrees. It ensures that the absolute difference between these heights does not exceed the allowed imbalance (which is 1 for AVL trees).
2. **Height Calculation Check**: The method verifies that the height of each node is correctly set to one more than the maximum height of its left and right children.
3. **Recursive Traversal**: The method recursively checks each node in the tree to ensure all nodes satisfy the above conditions.

This approach ensures that the AVL tree maintains its balance property and that the tree structure remains valid. If any violation is detected, the method returns `false`, indicating that the representation invariant has been broken.
