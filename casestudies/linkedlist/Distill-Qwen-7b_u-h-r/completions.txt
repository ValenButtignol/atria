Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the LinkedList class in Java. The representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the LinkedList class structure. It has a header Entry that's always present, a size variable, and methods like add, remove, clear, etc. The Entry class has element, next, and previous fields.

What properties should I check? Let's think:

1. The size should match the number of entries in the linked list. So, size() should equal the number of non-null elements in the linked list.

2. The linked list should be a cycle. Since the header's next and previous point to itself, adding an element before the header should link it into the cycle.

3. Each Entry's next and previous pointers should form a valid cycle. If next is not null, then previous should also be not null, except for the header which is a special case.

4. The header's next should point to the actual list's first Entry, and the previous should point to the last Entry.

5. The size should be non-negative because it's initialized to 0 and only incremented or decremented by 1.

6. The header should never be null because it's always initialized and never removed.

Let me structure these thoughts into the repOK method.

First, check if size is non-negative. If size is less than 0, return false.

Then, check if the header's next is null. If it is, return false because the linked list should be a cycle.

Next, traverse the linked list starting from header.next. For each Entry, check that both next and previous are not null. If any Entry has a null next or previous, the list is invalid.

Also, ensure that the last Entry's next points back to the header, maintaining the cycle.

Finally, verify that the size matches the number of entries in the linked list. Traverse each Entry and count how many have a non-null element. This count should equal the size.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks step by step.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (header.next == header) return false;
    Entry e = header.next;
    while (e != header) {
        if (e.next == null || e.previous == null) return false;
        e = e.next;
    }
    e.next = header;
    int count = 0;
    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.element != null) count++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    return count == size;
}
```
