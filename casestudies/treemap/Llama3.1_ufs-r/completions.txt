Here's a representation invariant for the TreeMap class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }

    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Node current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.color == RED) {
            if (current.left != null && current.left.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
            if (current.right != null && current.right.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        if (current.left != null && current.left.color == RED) {
            return false;
        }
        if (current.right != null && current.right.color == RED) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.left;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This representation invariant checks the following properties:

1. The size of the tree is non-negative.
2. If the tree is empty, the root is null.
3. If the tree is not empty, the root is not null.
4. If a node is red, its children are black.
5. If a node is red, its grandchildren are black.

This invariant ensures that the tree is a valid red-black tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree with a guarantee of O(log n) time for search, insert, and delete operations.
