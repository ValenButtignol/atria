Here's the representation invariant for the AvlTree class as a Java method called `repOK`:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is valid
    }

    // check that the tree is a valid binary search tree
    return repOK(root);

}

private boolean repOK(AvlNode t) {
    if (t == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is valid
    }

    // check that the tree is a valid binary search tree
    if (t.left != null && t.element <= t.left.element) {
        return false;
    }
    if (t.right != null && t.element >= t.right.element) {
        return false;
    }

    // check that the tree is balanced
    return Math.abs(height(t.left) - height(t.right)) <= ALLOWED_IMBALANCE
            && repOK(t.left) && repOK(t.right);
}

private int height(AvlNode t) {
    return t == null ? -1 : t.height;
}
```

This `repOK` method checks that the tree is a valid binary search tree and that it is balanced according to the AVL tree properties. If the tree is empty, it is considered valid. Otherwise, it checks that each node's left child is greater than its parent and its right child is less than its parent. It also checks that the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of each node does not exceed the allowed imbalance. If all these conditions are met, the tree is considered valid.
