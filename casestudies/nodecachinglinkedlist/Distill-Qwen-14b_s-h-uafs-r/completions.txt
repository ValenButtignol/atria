Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me start by understanding what this class does. 

From the code, I see that it's a linked list that caches nodes to optimize performance. The class has a header node, size, and cache-related variables. The cache has a maximum size, and nodes are added to or removed from the cache as needed.

The main methods are add, remove, and others like getNodeFromCache and addNodeToCache which manage the caching. The LinkedListNode class is a private inner class that represents each node, with previous and next pointers and a value.

So, the representation invariant, repOK(), should check all the invariants that must hold true for the object to be valid. Let me think about what these invariants could be.

First, the header node's previous and next should point to itself because it's a sentinel node. That's a fundamental invariant for a doubly linked list. So, I'll check that header.previous == header and header.next == header.

Next, every node except the header should have exactly two neighbors: previous and next. So, for each node, if it's not the header, its previous and next should not be null. Also, the size of the linked list should match the number of nodes, which can be calculated by traversing the list from the header.

Then, the cache management: the cache size should not exceed the maximum allowed. Also, any node in the cache should have its value set to null to indicate it's cached and not in use. Additionally, the firstCachedNode should only point to nodes that are actually in the cache.

I should also ensure that the linked list structure is consistent. For example, the next and previous pointers should form a cycle, meaning that traversing next from the header should eventually loop back to it.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check header's previous and next point to itself.
2. Ensure all nodes except header have non-null previous and next.
3. Verify that the size matches the actual count of nodes.
4. Check that cacheSize is within bounds (0 to maximumCacheSize).
5. Ensure cached nodes have null values.
6. Confirm that firstCachedNode only points to cached nodes.
7. Validate the linked list structure forms a cycle.

I'll write each of these checks as conditions in the repOK method. If any condition fails, the method returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the list is empty or when the cache is full or empty. Testing these scenarios will help ensure the invariants hold.

Now, I'll structure the repOK method with these checks, making sure each condition is clear and correctly implemented.

To write the representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the object's state is valid. The invariant should check the following properties:

1. The header node's previous and next pointers point to itself.
2. Every node (except the header) has valid previous and next pointers.
3. The size of the linked list is consistent with the actual number of nodes.
4. The cache size is within the allowed bounds.
5. Cached nodes have their values set to `null`.
6. The first cached node is only non-null if there are cached nodes.
7. The linked list structure is valid (i.e., it forms a cycle).

Here is the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header's previous and next point to itself
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all nodes except header have valid previous and next
    for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
        if (node.previous == null || node.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check size is consistent with actual node count
    int actualSize = 0;
    for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
        actualSize++;
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cached nodes have null values
    LinkedListNode cachedNode = firstCachedNode;
    while (cachedNode != null) {
        if (cachedNode.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        cachedNode = cachedNode.next;
    }

    // Check firstCachedNode is only non-null if cacheSize > 0
    if (cacheSize > 0 && firstCachedNode == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check linked list forms a cycle
    LinkedListNode currentNode = header.next;
    while (currentNode != header) {
        if (currentNode.next == null || currentNode.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This method ensures that all invariants of the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class are maintained, providing a robust check on the object's validity.
