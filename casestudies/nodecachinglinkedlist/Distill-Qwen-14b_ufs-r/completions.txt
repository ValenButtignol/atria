Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me think about what this class does and what invariants it should maintain.

First, looking at the class structure. It's a linked list that caches nodes to optimize memory usage. The class has several private fields: header, size, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize, and DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE.

The main operations are add and remove, which manipulate the linked list. The caching mechanism is used when creating new nodes; if there's space in the cache, it reuses a node instead of creating a new one.

So, the representation invariant should check that all the class's invariants are maintained after any operation. Let's break down what needs to be checked.

1. **Consistency of size**: The size variable should always correctly reflect the number of nodes in the list. So, I need to verify that size is accurate.

2. **Cache size constraints**: The cacheSize should never exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, it can't be negative, and when adding to the cache, it should respect this limit.

3. **Cache integrity**: The firstCachedNode should point to the head of the cache. Each cached node should have its next and previous pointers correctly set to maintain the cache order. Also, cached nodes should have their value set to null to indicate they're in the cache.

4. **Linked list structure**: The linked list must form a valid structure. Each node's previous and next pointers should correctly link to other nodes, ensuring there are no cycles or inconsistencies.

5. **Header node consistency**: The header node's previous and next should point to itself, maintaining the circular nature of the linked list.

6. **Node caching behavior**: When nodes are removed, they should be added back to the cache if the cache isn't full. Also, when adding new nodes, if the cache isn't full, a cached node should be reused.

Let me think about how to check each of these in the repOK method.

For size consistency, I can count the actual number of nodes in the list and compare it with the size variable. Starting from the header's next node, traverse until I come back to the header, counting each node.

Next, check that cacheSize is within bounds: 0 ≤ cacheSize ≤ maximumCacheSize.

For the cache, I need to ensure that the firstCachedNode is correctly maintained. Each node in the cache should have its value as null, and their next pointers should form a valid linked list among themselves.

To check the linked list structure, I can traverse the list starting from the header, ensuring that each node's previous and next pointers correctly link to other nodes, and that there are no cycles beyond the header.

Also, I should verify that the header's previous and next point to itself, maintaining the circular structure.

Another point is that any node that's in the cache should not be part of the active list. So, if a node is in the cache, it shouldn't be accessible through the linked list traversal.

Wait, but how do I differentiate between active nodes and cached nodes? Cached nodes have their value set to null. So during traversal, if a node's value is null, it's either a cached node or the header. But the header's value is null by default. Hmm, maybe I need a different way to track cached nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps the cache is a separate linked list of nodes that are not part of the main list. So, the firstCachedNode is the head of this cache, and each node in the cache has its next and previous pointers linking to other cache nodes, not the main list.

So, in the repOK method, I need to:

- Check that the size is correct.
- Check that cacheSize is within 0 to maximumCacheSize.
- Traverse the main list and ensure all nodes are correctly linked.
- Traverse the cache and ensure all cached nodes are correctly linked and have null values.
- Ensure that the header's next and previous are correctly set.

Let me outline the steps for repOK:

1. **Check header's prev and next**: header.previous should be header, and header.next should be header. If not, the list is empty but size is not zero, which is a problem.

2. **Check size consistency**: Traverse the list starting from header.next, count the nodes, and ensure it equals size.

3. **Check cache size constraints**: cacheSize must be between 0 and maximumCacheSize.

4. **Check cache integrity**:
   a. Traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode. Each node's next should point to the next cached node, and previous should point back. The traversal should stop when next is null.
   b. Each cached node's value should be null.
   c. The number of nodes in the cache should equal cacheSize.

5. **Check that no active node is in the cache**: When traversing the main list, none of the nodes (except header) should be part of the cache. How? Maybe by checking that their previous and next are not part of the cache's linked list.

Wait, that might be complicated. Alternatively, since the cache nodes have their value set to null, but the header also has a null value, perhaps that's not a reliable way. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the cache is a separate linked list of nodes that are not part of the main list. So, during traversal of the main list, none of the nodes (except header) should be in the cache.

But how to track that? Maybe each node in the cache should have a specific marker, but that's not part of the current code. So perhaps it's difficult to check this without additional fields.

Alternatively, perhaps the main list's nodes are those that are reachable from the header, excluding the cache. So, the cache is a separate structure.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

- Traverse the main list and collect all node references.
- Traverse the cache and collect all node references.
- Ensure that there's no overlap between the two sets, except for the header.

Wait, but the header is part of both? No, the header is part of the main list, not the cache. The cache nodes are separate.

So, the steps would be:

- Collect all nodes in the main list (excluding header).
- Collect all nodes in the cache.
- Ensure that these two sets are disjoint.

But how to implement this? It might be tricky without additional data structures.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the main list and cache are properly maintained, even if there's some overlap, but that might not be necessary for the repOK method.

Maybe for the purposes of this invariant, the main checks are:

- Size is correct.
- Cache size is within limits.
- The main list is a valid linked list.
- The cache is a valid linked list.
- All cached nodes have null values.

Let me think about how to implement each check.

1. **Header check**:
   - header.previous should be header.
   - header.next should be header.

2. **Size check**:
   - Traverse the main list starting from header.next, count nodes, and compare with size.

3. **Cache size check**:
   - Ensure cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.

4. **Cache traversal**:
   - Start from firstCachedNode.
   - For each node in the cache, check that its next and previous are correctly set, forming a valid linked list.
   - Each node's value should be null.
   - The number of nodes in the cache should equal cacheSize.

5. **Main list traversal**:
   - Each node's previous and next should correctly link to other nodes in the main list.
   - No cycles except the header.

6. **No overlapping nodes between main list and cache**:
   - When traversing the main list, none of the nodes (except header) should be present in the cache.

Wait, but how to track which nodes are in the cache? Because the cache is a linked list, perhaps I can collect all nodes in the cache into a set and then check that the main list doesn't contain any of them except the header.

But in the code, the cache is a separate linked list. So, the main list's nodes are those reachable from header.next, and the cache's nodes are reachable from firstCachedNode.

So, during repOK:

- Traverse the main list, collect all nodes except header into a set.
- Traverse the cache, collect all nodes into another set.
- Ensure that the two sets are disjoint.

This would prevent a node from being in both the main list and the cache.

But how to implement this in Java? It would require using a Set to track the nodes in the main list and then check the cache nodes against this set.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to ensure that the main list and cache are correctly maintained, even if there's some possibility of overlap, but that's risky.

Another point: when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the node is no longer part of the main list but is part of the cache. So, the main list and cache should not have overlapping nodes.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

- Create a set of all nodes in the main list (excluding header).
- Traverse the cache and for each node, check that it's not in the main list set.

This would ensure that no node is in both the main list and the cache.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would perform several checks:

1. Check that the header's previous and next point to itself.

2. Check that the size is correct by traversing the main list.

3. Check that the cache size is within bounds.

4. Check that the main list is a valid linked list with no cycles except at the header.

5. Check that the cache is a valid linked list.

6. Check that all cached nodes have null values.

7. Ensure that the main list and cache do not share any nodes (except header).

8. Ensure that the number of nodes in the main list plus the cache equals the initial capacity or something? Wait, no, because the initial capacity isn't tracked. Hmm, maybe not necessary.

Let me outline the code structure for repOK:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size consistency
    int actualSize = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main list structure
    current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.previous == null || current.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check cache structure
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        LinkedListNode cacheCurrent = firstCachedNode;
        Set<LinkedListNode> cacheNodes = new HashSet<>();
        while (cacheCurrent != null) {
            cacheNodes.add(cacheCurrent);
            if (cacheCurrent.next == null) {
                return false; // Cache should be a linked list, no null next except end
            }
            cacheCurrent = cacheCurrent.next;
        }
        if (cacheNodes.size() != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check all cache nodes have null values
        for (LinkedListNode node : cacheNodes) {
            if (node.value != null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check that main list and cache do not share nodes
    Set<LinkedListNode> mainNodes = new HashSet<>();
    current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        mainNodes.add(current);
        current = current.next;
    }
    // Now check cache nodes
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        cacheCurrent = firstCachedNode;
        while (cacheCurrent != null) {
            if (mainNodes.contains(cacheCurrent)) {
                return false;
            }
            cacheCurrent = cacheCurrent.next;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the code, the header is part of the main list, but it's not counted in the size. So, the mainNodes set includes all nodes except the header.

Wait, in the main list traversal, current starts at header.next, so the header itself is not included. So, the mainNodes set contains all active nodes.

The cacheNodes set contains all nodes in the cache.

So, the check is that none of the cache nodes are in the mainNodes set.

This should ensure that no node is both in the main list and the cache.

Another thing to check: when a node is added to the cache, its value is set to null. So, in the main list, all nodes should have non-null values except the header.

Wait, no. The header's value is null, but active nodes have their value set. So, in the main list, all nodes except the header should have non-null values.

So, another check: for each node in the main list (excluding header), node.value should not be null.

So, adding that to the repOK method:

// Check main list node values
current = header.next;
while (current != header) {
    if (current.value == null) {
        return false;
    }
    current = current.next;
}

This ensures that active nodes have valid values.

Putting all these together, the repOK method would perform multiple checks to ensure the class's invariants are maintained.
</think>

To write the representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that all internal data structures are consistent and adhere to the class's invariants. The invariant will check the integrity of the linked list, the cache, and the relationships between nodes.

### Representation Invariant Code

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header's previous and next pointers
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size consistency by traversing the main list
    int actualSize = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size constraints
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main list structure and node values
    current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.previous == null || current.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (current.value == null) {
            return false; // Active nodes should have non-null values
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check cache structure if cache is not empty
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        LinkedListNode cacheCurrent = firstCachedNode;
        Set<LinkedListNode> cacheNodes = new HashSet<>();
        while (cacheCurrent != null) {
            cacheNodes.add(cacheCurrent);
            if (cacheCurrent.next == null) {
                return false; // Cache should form a proper linked list
            }
            cacheCurrent = cacheCurrent.next;
        }
        if (cacheNodes.size() != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check all cache nodes have null values
        for (LinkedListNode node : cacheNodes) {
            if (node.value != null) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Check that cache nodes are not in the main list
        Set<LinkedListNode> mainNodes = new HashSet<>();
        current = header.next;
        while (current != header) {
            mainNodes.add(current);
            current = current.next;
        }
        for (LinkedListNode node : cacheNodes) {
            if (mainNodes.contains(node)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

The `repOK` method performs several checks to ensure the integrity of the `NodeCachingLinkedList`:

1. **Header Check**: Ensures the header node's `previous` and `next` pointers correctly point to itself, maintaining the circular structure.

2. **Size Consistency**: Traverses the main list to count the actual number of nodes and compares it with the `size` variable.

3. **Cache Size Constraints**: Verifies that the `cacheSize` is within the valid range (0 to `maximumCacheSize`).

4. **Main List Structure**: Checks that each node in the main list has valid `previous` and `next` pointers and that their values are non-null.

5. **Cache Structure**: If the cache is non-empty, it verifies that the cache forms a valid linked list, each node has a null value, and no node in the cache is part of the main list.

6. **Node Values**: Ensures that active nodes in the main list have non-null values, while cached nodes have null values.

By performing these checks, the `repOK` method ensures that the `NodeCachingLinkedList` maintains its invariants and operates correctly.
