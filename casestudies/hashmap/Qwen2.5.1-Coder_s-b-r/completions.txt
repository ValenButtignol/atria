To write a representation invariant for the `HashMap` class, we need to ensure that the internal state of the `HashMap` is consistent and valid according to its design. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Table Initialization**: The `table` array should not be null and should have a length that is a power of 2.
2. **Size Consistency**: The `size` field should accurately reflect the number of entries in the `HashMap`.
3. **Threshold Calculation**: The `threshold` should be calculated correctly based on the `loadFactor` and the current `table` size.
4. **Entry Consistency**: Each entry in the `table` should be consistent with the `size` and `threshold`.
5. **Null Key Handling**: The `NULL_KEY` should be used to handle null keys correctly.

Here is the `repOK` method that checks these invariants:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if table is not null and its length is a power of 2
    if (table == null || (table.length & (table.length - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if threshold is calculated correctly
    if (threshold <= 0 || threshold > table.length * loadFactor) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check each entry in the table
    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        int count = 0;
        while (e != null) {
            count++;
            e = e.next;
        }
        if (count != 0 && count != 1) {
            return false; // Each bucket should have either 0 or 1 entry
        }
    }

    // Check if size matches the number of entries in the table
    int actualSize = 0;
    for (Entry e : table) {
        while (e != null) {
            actualSize++;
            e = e.next;
        }
    }
    if (size != actualSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if NULL_KEY is used correctly
    if (NULL_KEY == null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This `repOK` method checks the following:
- The `table` array is not null and its length is a power of 2.
- The `size` is non-negative.
- The `threshold` is calculated correctly based on the `loadFactor` and the current `table` size.
- Each bucket in the `table` contains either 0 or 1 entry.
- The `size` matches the actual number of entries in the `table`.
- The `NULL_KEY` is not null.

This ensures that the `HashMap` is in a valid state according to its design.
