Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. I'm not super familiar with all the details of this class, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

First, I'll look at the class structure. It's a linked list with some caching functionality. There's a header node, a size variable, a maximumCacheSize, a cacheSize, and a firstCachedNode. The remove and add methods use this caching mechanism.

I remember that a representation invariant is a property that must always hold true for the object to be considered valid. So, I need to think about what properties of the linked list and the cache are always true.

Let's start with the size. The size variable should always equal the number of nodes in the linked list. That makes sense because every time we add or remove a node, size is updated. So, I'll write a check to ensure that size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list.

Next, the cacheSize should never exceed the maximumCacheSize. The cache is supposed to be a limited-size cache, so if the cache is full, adding another node shouldn't be allowed. I'll write a condition to check that cacheSize is less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.

Then, the firstCachedNode should point to a node that's part of the linked list. If the cache is empty, firstCachedNode should be null. Otherwise, it should point to a node that's actually in the linked list. I'll check that if firstCachedNode is not null, its previous node is the header, and its next node is part of the linked list.

Also, the cacheSize should never be negative. Since it starts at 0 and only increases or stays the same, I'll ensure that cacheSize is greater than or equal to 0.

Putting it all together, I'll write a method repOK that returns true if all these conditions are met and false otherwise. I'll make sure to cover all the aspects I thought of: size correctness, cache limits, and the integrity of the cached nodes.

I think that's a solid set of checks. Now, I'll translate these thoughts into Java code for the repOK method.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check that the size matches the number of nodes in the linked list
    if (size != countNodes(header)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that cacheSize does not exceed maximumCacheSize
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that firstCachedNode is null or points to a valid cached node
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode cachedNode = firstCachedNode;
        if (cachedNode.previous != header || cachedNode.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        // Ensure the cached node is part of the main linked list
        if (!isNodeInList(cachedNode)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check that cacheSize is non-negative
    if (cacheSize < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private int countNodes(LinkedListNode header) {
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        count++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    return count;
}

private boolean isNodeInList(LinkedListNode node) {
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (isEqualValue(node.getValue(), current.getValue())) {
            return true;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    return false;
}
```
