Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class in Java. The representation invariant is a boolean method that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties I'm completely sure about.

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has a header node, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. The constructor initializes these fields.

I should check if all the fields are properly initialized. The header should not be null, and the initial size should be 0. The cacheSize should start at 0, and maximumCacheSize should be set to the default value of 20.

Next, looking at the methods, the remove method iterates through the linked list, so the linked list should be properly formed. The add method adds to the end, so the linked list shouldn't have any issues there.

In the addNode methods, nodes are added before a given node, so the links should be consistent. The createNode method uses getNodeFromCache, which returns null if the cache is empty, so that should be checked.

The removeNode method calls super_removeNode, which modifies the links, so I need to ensure that after removal, the links are correctly updated. Also, after removing, the node should be added back to the cache, so the cacheSize should be incremented correctly.

The addNodeToCache method checks if the cache is full before adding, so the cacheSize should never exceed maximumCacheSize. The isCacheFull method correctly checks if cacheSize is greater than or equal to maximumCacheSize.

The size field should always equal the cacheSize because every time a node is added or removed, size and cacheSize are updated accordingly.

I should also ensure that the header's next points to the first node, and that the first node's previous is null. The firstCachedNode's next should point to the next cached node, and its previous should be null initially.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should check all these invariants. I'll write a series of assertions for each field and method to ensure they're consistent and correctly updated.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Header node should not be null
    if (header == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Size should equal cacheSize
    if (size != cacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Header's next should point to the first node
    if (header.next != firstCachedNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // First node's previous should be null
    if (firstCachedNode != null && firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Maximum cache size should be at least the default value
    if (maximumCacheSize < DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE) {
        return false;
    }

    // Cache size should not exceed maximum cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Header's next should point to the first node (again)
    if (header.next != firstCachedNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // First node's previous should be null (again)
    if (firstCachedNode != null && firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // All checks passed
    return true;
}
```
