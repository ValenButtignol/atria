Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. I'm not super familiar with Java, but I know that a representation invariant is like a condition that must always be true for the object to be considered valid. It's a way to ensure that the internal state of the object remains consistent.

Looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class, it seems to be a linked list with some caching functionality. There are methods like remove, add, addLast, addNodeBefore, addNode, getNodeFromCache, isCacheFull, addNodeToCache, createNode, removeNode, super_removeNode, isEqualValue, and some helper methods for the LinkedListNode class.

First, I should think about what properties of the linked list must always hold true. Normally, in a linked list, each node has a previous and next pointer, and the last node's next is null. Also, the size should reflect the number of nodes.

But this class has some caching logic. There's a header node, a cache size, and a firstCachedNode. The cache is used to store nodes, and when the cache is full, adding a new node doesn't increase the size unless it's added to the cache.

So, I need to make sure that the size is correctly updated whether a node is added normally or cached. Also, the cache should not exceed the maximum size.

Another thing is that when a node is removed, it should be added back to the cache if there's space. So, the size should decrease when a node is removed, but then increase when it's added back to the cache.

I should also consider the invariant that the cache contains nodes that are part of the linked list. So, if a node is in the cache, it should exist in the linked list.

Let me think about the size. Normally, size is the number of nodes in the linked list. But when a node is added to the cache, the size should increase by one. When a node is removed, the size should decrease by one, even if it's added back to the cache.

Wait, no. When you remove a node, you first remove it from the linked list, which decreases the size. Then, you add it back to the cache, which increases the size. So, the net effect is that the size remains the same.

But in the remove method, after removing the node from the linked list, it's added back to the cache. So, the size should decrease by one when removing, and then increase by one when adding back, keeping the overall size consistent.

Hmm, but in the code, when removeNode is called, it calls super_removeNode, which removes the node from the linked list and decreases the size. Then, it calls addNodeToCache, which adds the node back to the cache and increases the size.

So, the size should always reflect the current number of nodes in the linked list, regardless of whether some nodes are in the cache or not.

Another thing is the cache. The cache should not have more nodes than the maximumCacheSize. So, the cacheSize should never exceed maximumCacheSize.

Also, the firstCachedNode should point to the first node in the cache, and the cacheSize should be the number of nodes in the cache.

Wait, but the cache is a part of the linked list. So, the cache nodes are part of the linked list, and the size should include them.

I think the main invariants are:

1. The size of the linked list is correctly maintained, including when nodes are added to or removed from the cache.

2. The cache size does not exceed the maximumCacheSize.

3. The firstCachedNode correctly points to the first node in the cache.

4. The cacheSize is the number of nodes in the cache.

5. When a node is added to the cache, its value is updated in the node, and the node is linked into the cache.

6. When a node is removed from the cache, it's also removed from the linked list.

So, putting this together, the representation invariant should check that:

- The size of the linked list is correctly maintained.

- The cache size does not exceed the maximum.

- The firstCachedNode is not null unless the cache is empty.

- The cacheSize matches the number of nodes in the cache.

- The size of the linked list equals the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

Wait, but the size of the linked list should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache. But since the cache is part of the linked list, the size should always be equal to the number of nodes in the cache.

Wait, no. The size is the total number of nodes in the linked list, which includes both the cache and non-cache nodes. But in this class, all nodes are either in the cache or not. So, the size should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

But since the cache is a subset of the linked list, the size should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

Wait, but in the code, when a node is added to the cache, the size increases by one, and when it's removed from the cache, the size decreases by one. So, the size should always equal the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

But in the code, when you add a node to the cache, you create a new node if it's not cached, and then update the cached node's value. So, the size increases by one.

When you remove a node from the cache, you remove it from the linked list, so the size decreases by one.

So, the size should always equal the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

But since the cache is part of the linked list, the size should always equal the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache.

Wait, but the size is maintained correctly because when you add a node to the cache, you increase the size, and when you remove it from the cache, you decrease the size.
