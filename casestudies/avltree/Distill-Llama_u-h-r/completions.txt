Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I should understand what the AvlTree class does. It's a balanced binary search tree using the Avl algorithm. The key properties to check are balance and structure correctness.

I remember that in an Avl tree, each node must be balanced such that the height difference between the left and right subtrees doesn't exceed a certain threshold, which in this case is ALLOWED_IMBALANCE set to 1. So, I need to verify that for every node, the height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree is not more than 1, and vice versa.

Also, I should check that the tree is properly structured. That means every node must have either a left child, a right child, or both, but not both missing. Additionally, the root should not be null because the tree should be initialized correctly.

So, the steps for the repOK method would be:
1. Check if the root is null. If it is, return false because the tree is empty and invalid.
2. Recursively check each node to ensure the balance condition is met. For each node, calculate the height difference between left and right. If any node violates the balance condition, return false.
3. Ensure that each node has either a left or right child, or both, but not neither. If any node lacks both children, return false.
4. If all checks pass, return true.

I should write this as a boolean method in the AvlTree class. The method will call a helper function, maybe checkBalance, which will perform the recursive checks. The helper will take a node and check its left and right subtrees, ensuring the balance condition and structure correctness.

I need to make sure that the helper function correctly traverses all nodes and checks each condition. Also, the main method will handle the root check before calling the helper.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will first check if the root is null. If not, it will call the helper function to verify all nodes' balance and structure. If any condition fails, repOK returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

I think that covers all necessary points. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

To determine if an AvlTree instance is valid, the `repOK` method verifies that the tree is properly structured and balanced according to the Avl algorithm's rules.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if the node has either left or right child, or both
    if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check balance condition
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    int diff = leftHeight - rightHeight;

    if (Math.abs(diff) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}
```
