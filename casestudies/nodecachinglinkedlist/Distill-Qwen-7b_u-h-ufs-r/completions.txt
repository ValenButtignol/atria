Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me think about what this class does. From the code, it looks like it's a linked list with a cache mechanism. When adding a node, if it's already in the cache, it's updated; otherwise, it's added to the cache. The cache has a maximum size, and once it's full, new additions are either cached or cause the cache to grow until it reaches the maximum.

So, the representation invariant should ensure that the state of the object is consistent and correct. Let's break down the key components:

1. **Cache Management**: The cache should not exceed the maximum size. So, the cacheSize should always be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. Also, when the cache is full, adding a new node shouldn't proceed unless the cache is not full.

2. **Node Structure**: Each node in the linked list should have correct previous and next pointers. The super_removeNode method is used to remove a node, which adjusts the previous and next pointers of surrounding nodes. So, the structure should maintain proper links.

3. **Cache State**: The firstCachedNode should point to the head of the cache chain. The cacheSize should accurately reflect the number of cached nodes. Also, when a node is removed from the main list, it should be added back to the cache if there's space.

4. **Node Values**: When a node is added from the cache, its value is updated, but the structure of the linked list remains the same. So, the links shouldn't be affected by value changes.

5. **Edge Cases**: The header node is used to simplify traversal, but it shouldn't be part of the actual linked list. The size of the linked list (excluding the header) should be accurate.

Putting this together, the repOK method should check:

- CacheSize doesn't exceed maximumCacheSize.
- The structure of the linked list is correct, with proper previous and next pointers.
- The firstCachedNode correctly points to the start of the cache chain.
- The cacheSize matches the number of cached nodes.
- The header node is correctly handled, not being counted in the size.
- When a node is removed, it's properly added back to the cache if possible.

I should also ensure that the method returns false if any of these conditions are violated. So, each check should return false immediately if any condition fails, ensuring the invariant is maintained.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    if (firstCachedNode == null && !isEmpty()) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size != (firstCachedNode != null ? numCachedNodes() : 0)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!isValidStructure()) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

private boolean isValidStructure() {
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    int expectedSize = size;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.previous == null && current.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (current.next == null && current.previous != null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    return true;
}

private int numCachedNodes() {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    int count = 0;
    do {
        count++;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current != null);
    return count;
}
```
