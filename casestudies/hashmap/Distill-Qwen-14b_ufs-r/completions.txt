Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class. The repOK method should check all the invariants that must hold true for the object's state to be valid. Let me think about what these invariants could be.

First, looking at the HashMap structure. It has an array called table, which is an array of Entry objects. Each Entry has a key, value, hash, and a next pointer for collision handling. The size variable keeps track of the number of key-value pairs. There's also a threshold which determines when the table should be resized, based on the load factor.

So, what invariants must hold?

1. **Consistency between size and the actual number of entries:**
   The size variable should equal the total number of entries in the table. I can traverse all the entries in the table and count them to verify this.

2. **No null keys except for the special NULL_KEY:**
   The HashMap uses a special NULL_KEY object to represent null keys. So, any Entry's key should either be NULL_KEY or not null. I need to check that no Entry has a null key except when it's the NULL_KEY instance.

3. **Correctness of hash values:**
   Each Entry's hash should be computed correctly using the hash method provided. I can compare the hash stored in the Entry with the hash computed from the key.

4. **Load factor consistency:**
   The threshold should be equal to the capacity multiplied by the load factor. I can check if threshold equals capacity * loadFactor.

5. **No duplicate keys:**
   Each key should be unique in the HashMap. I can traverse each bucket and ensure that within each bucket, all keys are unique.

6. **Proper handling of Entry.next pointers:**
   The linked list formed by Entry.next in each bucket should not have any cycles, ensuring that each bucket is a proper linked list without loops.

7. **Consistency of Entry equality:**
   The equals method for Entry should correctly compare keys and values. I can test if two Entries are considered equal according to their equals method.

Let me outline each check step by step.

For the first check, I can iterate through each bucket in the table and count all non-null entries. The sum should equal the size variable.

The second check involves ensuring that for every Entry, the key is either the special NULL_KEY or not null. If any Entry has a null key that's not the special one, that's invalid.

Third, for each Entry, I'll compute the hash of its key (unmasking if necessary) and compare it with the stored hash. They should match.

Fourth, I'll verify that threshold is indeed capacity multiplied by loadFactor. But wait, the capacity is the length of the table array. So, threshold should be (table.length * loadFactor), but since it's an int, it's probably the floor or ceiling. Looking at the code, in the constructor, threshold is (int) (capacity * loadFactor). So I can compute that and compare.

Fifth, for each bucket, I need to ensure that all keys are unique. I can collect all the keys (unmasking NULL_KEY to null) and check for duplicates.

Sixth, to check for cycles in the Entry.next pointers, I can traverse each linked list starting from each bucket. I'll keep track of visited entries to detect if any node is revisited, which would indicate a cycle.

Seventh, I can take a couple of Entry objects and test their equals method to ensure it works as expected. For example, two Entries with the same key and value should be equal, and if any component differs, they shouldn't be.

Putting this all together, the repOK method will perform these checks and return true only if all of them pass.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the table is empty, or when there's only one entry, etc. For example, if size is zero, the table should be all null, and root should be null in the tree case, but wait, this is a HashMap, not a tree. So, in the HashMap, if size is zero, all entries in the table should be null.

Another thing: when resizing, the old table entries are transferred correctly. But the repOK doesn't need to check the resizing logic, just the current state.

I think I've covered all the necessary checks. Now, I'll structure the repOK method to perform each of these validations step by step, returning false as soon as any invariant fails.
</think>

To write the representation invariant for the `HashMap` class, we need to ensure that the internal state of the object adheres to the expected properties. The `repOK` method will perform several checks to validate the invariants.

### Representation Invariant for HashMap

The `repOK` method will check the following invariants:

1. **Consistency between size and the number of entries:**
   The `size` variable must equal the total number of entries in the hash table.

2. **No null keys except for the special `NULL_KEY`:**
   Each entry's key must either be the special `NULL_KEY` or not null.

3. **Correctness of hash values:**
   The hash value stored in each entry must match the hash computed from the key.

4. **Load factor consistency:**
   The `threshold` must be equal to the product of the current capacity and the `loadFactor`.

5. **No duplicate keys:**
   All keys in the hash table must be unique.

6. **Proper handling of Entry.next pointers:**
   The linked lists formed by `Entry.next` must not contain cycles.

7. **Consistency of Entry equality:**
   The `equals` method for `Entry` must correctly compare keys and values.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check 1: Size consistency
    int actualSize = 0;
    for (Entry[] tab : table) {
        for (Entry e = tab; e != null; e = e.next) {
            actualSize++;
        }
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check 2: No null keys except for NULL_KEY
    for (Entry[] tab : table) {
        for (Entry e = tab; e != null; e = e.next) {
            Object key = e.key;
            if (key != NULL_KEY && key == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check 3: Correct hash values
    for (Entry[] tab : table) {
        for (Entry e = tab; e != null; e = e.next) {
            Object key = e.key;
            Object maskedKey = (key == NULL_KEY) ? null : key;
            int computedHash = hash(maskedKey);
            if (computedHash != e.hash) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check 4: Load factor consistency
    int capacity = table.length;
    int expectedThreshold = (int) (capacity * loadFactor);
    if (threshold != expectedThreshold) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check 5: No duplicate keys
    Set<Object> keys = new HashSet<>();
    for (Entry[] tab : table) {
        for (Entry e = tab; e != null; e = e.next) {
            Object key = e.key == NULL_KEY ? null : e.key;
            if (key == null) {
                if (keys.contains(null)) {
                    return false;
                }
                keys.add(null);
            } else {
                if (keys.contains(key)) {
                    return false;
                }
                keys.add(key);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check 6: No cycles in Entry.next pointers
    Set<Entry> visited = new HashSet<>();
    for (Entry[] tab : table) {
        for (Entry e = tab; e != null; e = e.next) {
            if (visited.contains(e)) {
                return false;
            }
            visited.add(e);
        }
    }

    // Check 7: Entry equality consistency
    Entry e1 = new Entry(hash("test"), "test", "value", null);
    Entry e2 = new Entry(hash("test"), "test", "value", null);
    Entry e3 = new Entry(hash("test"), "test", "different", null);
    if (!e1.equals(e2) || e1.equals(e3)) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This `repOK` method systematically verifies each invariant, ensuring the integrity of the `HashMap`'s internal state.
