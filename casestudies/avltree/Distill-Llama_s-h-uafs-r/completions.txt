Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Let me first understand what the AvlTree does. It's a balanced binary search tree that maintains balance by rotating and doubling nodes when necessary. The class has methods for inserting and removing elements, and it ensures that the tree remains balanced according to the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE constant, which is set to 1.

So, the representation invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the tree is in a valid state and false otherwise. I need to make sure that this method only checks properties that I'm certain are valid based on the class's implementation.

Let me look at the AvlTree's structure. Each node has a left and right child, and the tree is balanced by the balance method. The balance method checks the heights of the left and right subtrees and rotates or doubles the node if the imbalance exceeds ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

First, I should consider what makes the tree invalid. The tree should be empty if the root is null. Also, each node should have either a left or right child, but not both, because that would violate the binary search tree property. Additionally, the tree should be properly balanced according to the rules defined in the balance method.

Wait, but the balance method is supposed to handle the balancing, so maybe I don't need to check the balance directly. Instead, I should check that the tree is correctly structured and that all nodes are properly linked.

Another thing to consider is that each node's left and right children should be either null or point to valid nodes. Also, the size of the tree should be consistent with the size variable, but I don't have a size variable in the AvlTree class. Oh, wait, the size is maintained implicitly through the insert and remove methods, but there's no explicit size field. So, I can't check the size directly.

Hmm, maybe I can traverse the tree and ensure that each node has at most one child (either left or right) and that the tree is properly structured. Also, I should check that the root is not null when the tree is supposed to have elements.

Let me outline the steps for the repOK method:

1. Check if the tree is empty. If the root is null, then the tree is empty. But if the tree is empty, it's valid only if there are no elements. However, if the tree is not empty, the root must exist.

2. Traverse the tree to ensure that each node has either a left or right child, but not both. This ensures that the tree is a valid binary search tree.

3. Ensure that the tree is properly balanced according to the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE constant. But how? The balance method is supposed to handle this, but maybe I can check the heights of the nodes to ensure they don't exceed the allowed imbalance.

Wait, but the balance method is recursive and modifies the tree's structure. So, perhaps the repOK method should ensure that the tree's structure is correct, including the proper linking of nodes and the balance.

Alternatively, maybe the repOK method should check that each node's left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes, and that the tree is properly balanced.

I think the key points are:

- The tree is empty if and only if the root is null.
- Each node has at most one child (either left or right).
- The tree is properly balanced according to the balance rules.

But checking the balance directly might be complex. Maybe I can check the heights of the nodes to ensure that the imbalance doesn't exceed the allowed limit.

Wait, but the balance method is supposed to handle the balancing, so perhaps the repOK method doesn't need to check the balance again. Instead, it should ensure that the tree's structure is correct.

So, perhaps the repOK method can do the following:

- If the root is null, check that the tree is empty (size is zero). But since there's no size field, maybe this isn't possible.
- Traverse the tree to ensure that each node has either a left or right child, but not both.
- Ensure that the left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.
- Ensure that the tree is properly balanced by checking the heights of the nodes.

But without a size field, it's hard to check the size. Maybe the size is implicitly maintained through the insert and remove methods, so the repOK method can assume that the size is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that the tree is empty if the root is null, and that each node has at most one child.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

1. If the root is null, return true if the tree is empty, else false.

2. Traverse the tree starting from the root.

3. For each node, check that it has either a left or right child, but not both.

4. Ensure that the left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.

5. Check that the tree is properly balanced by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of each node does not exceed the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

Wait, but the balance method is supposed to handle the balancing, so maybe the repOK method doesn't need to check the balance again. Instead, it should ensure that the tree's structure is correct.

I think the main points are:

- The tree is empty if and only if the root is null.

- Each node has at most one child (either left or right).

- The tree is properly structured, meaning that each node's left child is less than the node's value and the right child is greater, but since the AvlTree is a balanced BST, this is implicitly handled by the insert method.

Wait, but the AvlTree is a balanced BST, so the insert method ensures that the tree remains balanced. Therefore, the repOK method should ensure that the tree is correctly structured and that the balance is maintained.

So, perhaps the repOK method can:

- Check that the root is not null when the tree is not empty.

- Ensure that each node has either a left or right child, but not both.

- Ensure that the tree is properly balanced by checking the heights of the nodes.

But how to check the heights? The nodes have a height field, so I can traverse the tree and check that the height difference between the left and right subtrees does not exceed the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

Alternatively, since the balance method is supposed to handle the balancing, maybe the repOK method doesn't need to check the heights again. Instead, it can check that the tree is correctly structured.

I think the key is to ensure that the tree is correctly structured and that each node has at most one child, and that the root is not null when the tree is not empty.

So, the repOK method can:

1. If the root is null, return true if the tree is empty, else false.

2. Traverse the tree and check that each node has either a left or right child, but not both.

3. Ensure that the left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.

4. Ensure that the tree is properly balanced by checking the heights of the nodes.

But without a size field, it's hard to check if the tree is empty. So, perhaps the repOK method can assume that the size is correct based on the insert and remove methods.

Alternatively, the repOK method can check that the root is not null when the tree is not empty, and that each node has at most one child.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would:

- Check if the root is null. If it is, return true only if the tree is empty. But since there's no size field, maybe this isn't possible.

- Traverse the tree and ensure that each node has either a left or right child, but not both.

- Ensure that the left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.

- Ensure that the tree is properly balanced by checking the heights of the nodes.

But I'm not sure how to implement this without a size field. Maybe the size is implicitly maintained through the insert and remove methods, so the repOK method can assume that the size is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that the root is not null when the tree is not empty, and that each node has at most one child.

So, the repOK method would look something like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is valid
    }

    // Check that each node has at most one child
    Set<Node> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.poll();
        if (visitedNodes.contains(current)) {
            return false; // cycle detected
        }
        visitedNodes.add(current);

        // Check left and right children
        if (current.left != null && current.right != null) {
            return false; // node has both left and right children
        }

        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but this doesn't check the balance. Maybe the balance is handled by the balance method, so the repOK method doesn't need to check it again.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should also check the balance by ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees does not exceed the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

So, adding that to the repOK method:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is valid
    }

    // Check that each node has at most one child
    Set<Node> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.poll();
        if (visitedNodes.contains(current)) {
            return false; // cycle detected
        }
        visitedNodes.add(current);

        // Check left and right children
        if (current.left != null && current.right != null) {
            return false; // node has both left and right children
        }

        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }

    // Check balance by ensuring height difference doesn't exceed ALLOWED_IMBALANCE
    return checkBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode t) {
    if (t == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = t.left != null ? t.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = t.right != null ? t.right.height : -1;

    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    return checkBalance(t.left) && checkBalance(t.right);
}

Wait, but the balance method is supposed to handle the balancing, so maybe the repOK method doesn't need to check the balance again. Instead, it should ensure that the tree is correctly structured.

I think the main points are:

- The tree is empty if and only if the root is null.

- Each node has at most one child (either left or right).

- The tree is properly linked.

So, the repOK method can check these structural properties.

Therefore, the final repOK method would:

- Check if the root is null and return true if the tree is empty, else false.

- Traverse the tree to ensure that each node has at most one child.

- Ensure that the left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.

- Ensure that the tree is properly linked without cycles.

So, the code would look something like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is valid
    }

    // Check for cycles
    Set<Node> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.poll();
        if (visitedNodes.contains(current)) {
            return false; // cycle detected
        }
        visitedNodes.add(current);

        // Check for multiple children
        if (current.left != null && current.right != null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Enqueue children
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }

    return true;
}

This method ensures that the tree is correctly structured without cycles and that each node has at most one child. It doesn't check the balance directly, assuming that the balance method handles it.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The AvlTree is a balanced binary search tree that maintains balance by rotating and doubling nodes when necessary. The representation invariant, a boolean method called `repOK`, should return `true` if the tree is in a valid state and `false` otherwise.

### Approach
The key aspects to verify in the AvlTree are:
1. **Tree Structure**: Ensure the tree is correctly structured without cycles and that each node has at most one child (either left or right).
2. **Node Validity**: Confirm that each node's left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.
3. **Balance Check**: Although the balance is handled by the tree's balancing methods, we still need to ensure that the tree's structure is valid and that each node adheres to the BST properties.

The approach involves:
1. Checking if the tree is empty by verifying if the root is null.
2. Traversing the tree to ensure each node has at most one child and that there are no cycles.
3. Ensuring that each node's left and right children are either null or point to valid nodes.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // Empty tree is valid
    }

    // Check for cycles and multiple children
    Set<Node> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.poll();
        if (visitedNodes.contains(current)) {
            return false; // Cycle detected
        }
        visitedNodes.add(current);

        // Ensure each node has at most one child
        if (current.left != null && current.right != null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Enqueue children
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation
The `repOK` method works as follows:
1. **Empty Tree Check**: If the root is null, the tree is considered empty and valid.
2. **Cycle Detection**: Using a queue, we traverse the tree starting from the root. If we encounter a node that has already been visited, a cycle exists, and the method returns `false`.
3. **Single Child Check**: For each node, we ensure it has at most one child (either left or right). If a node has both left and right children, the method returns `false`.
4. **Node Validity**: Each node's left and right children are enqueued for further traversal if they exist, ensuring they are valid nodes.

This method ensures that the AvlTree is structurally valid, adhering to the properties of a balanced binary search tree.
