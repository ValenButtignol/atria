Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class in Java. The invariant should be a method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I'll look at the structure of the HashMap class. It has several instance variables: table (an array of Entry objects), size, threshold, loadFactor, and modCount. 

The repOK method should check that all these variables are consistent and in a valid state. 

Let me think about each variable:

1. **table**: It's an array of Entry objects. Each Entry should not be null, but wait, no, in the constructor, they are initialized to null. So the table array can have null entries. But each bucket (array element) can have a linked list of Entries. So the table itself is valid as long as it's an array of Entry objects, which can be null.

2. **size**: This should be the number of key-value pairs in the map. So I need to ensure that size is non-negative and doesn't exceed the maximum possible.

3. **threshold**: This is the value used to determine when to resize the table. It should be less than or equal to the current capacity of the table. Also, when the size exceeds the threshold, the table should be resized. So I need to check that threshold is within the bounds of the table's length.

4. **loadFactor**: This is a float that should be positive and not NaN. The constructor already checks this, but perhaps in the repOK, I should verify that it's within a valid range, like greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, but wait, the load factor can be any positive value, but in practice, it's usually between 0 and 1. Hmm, but the constructor allows any positive load factor, so perhaps the repOK should just check that it's positive and not NaN.

5. **modCount**: This is a volatile int used for tracking modifications. It should be non-negative, but since it's incremented, it can be zero or positive.

Now, considering the invariants:

- The table's length should be a power of two because the indexFor method uses a bitwise AND with (length - 1), which works correctly only if the table length is a power of two. So I need to check that table.length is a power of two.

- The threshold should be equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor). But wait, in the constructor, threshold is set as (int)(capacity * loadFactor). So in the repOK, I should verify that threshold equals (int)(table.length * loadFactor). However, due to integer casting, it's possible that threshold could be slightly higher, but in the resize method, when the size exceeds threshold, it resizes. So perhaps the repOK should check that threshold is less than or equal to table.length * loadFactor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check that threshold is equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor), but considering that the initial threshold is set that way, and after resizing, it's recalculated. So in a valid state, threshold should be equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor).

Wait, looking at the code:

In the constructor, threshold is set as (int)(capacity * loadFactor). Similarly, in the resize method, after resizing, threshold is set as (int)(newCapacity * loadFactor). So in a valid state, threshold should be equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor). So the repOK should check that threshold == (int)(table.length * loadFactor).

But wait, when the capacity is increased, the threshold is recalculated. So yes, in a valid state, threshold should be equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor).

Another point: the size should not exceed the threshold, because if it did, the map would have resized. So size <= threshold.

Also, the size should be non-negative and not exceed the maximum capacity.

Additionally, each Entry in the table should have a non-null next pointer, except for the last Entry in a bucket, which can be null. Wait, no, the Entry's next can be null, as it's the end of the chain.

But in the repOK, perhaps we don't need to check each Entry's structure because that's the responsibility of the Entry's own invariants. Or maybe not, since the Entry is part of the HashMap's state.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK should ensure that all Entries are properly linked and that the size is correctly maintained.

But for the sake of the repOK method, which is part of the HashMap, perhaps it's sufficient to check the main variables: table, size, threshold, loadFactor, modCount.

So putting it all together, the repOK method should check:

- table is not null.
- table.length is a power of two.
- threshold is equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor).
- size is between 0 and the maximum capacity, and size <= threshold.
- loadFactor is positive and not NaN.
- modCount is non-negative.

Wait, but the loadFactor is already set in the constructor, and the constructor checks that it's positive and not NaN. So perhaps in repOK, we can assume that loadFactor is valid, but to be safe, perhaps we should recheck it.

Also, the modCount is volatile, but it's an int, so it should be >=0.

So the steps for repOK:

1. Check that table is not null and its length is a power of two.

2. Check that threshold equals (int)(table.length * loadFactor).

3. Check that size is >=0 and <= threshold.

4. Check that loadFactor is positive and not NaN.

5. Check that modCount is >=0.

6. Ensure that the size does not exceed the maximum capacity, which is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

Wait, the maximum capacity is 2^30, which is a very large number. So perhaps in the repOK, we can check that size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

But looking at the code, the initial capacity is capped at MAXIMUM_CAPACITY in the constructor. So the size can't exceed that.

So in the repOK, perhaps we can include:

size >=0 && size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

But wait, the size is the number of entries, which can't exceed the maximum capacity. So yes.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would perform these checks.

Now, let me think about how to implement each check.

For table being non-null: if (table == null) return false.

For table length being a power of two: We can check that (table.length & (table.length -1)) == 0. But wait, what if table.length is zero? Well, in the constructor, the initial capacity is at least 1, so table.length should be at least 16, which is a power of two. So in a valid state, table.length is a power of two and >=16.

Wait, no. The initial capacity can be 1 if the initialCapacity is 1, but in the constructor, it's set to the next power of two. Wait, looking at the constructor:

In the constructor, initialCapacity is set to the next power of two. So table.length is always a power of two, and at least 16 if initialCapacity is >=16, but if initialCapacity is 1, it would be set to 1, but wait, no: the code says:

int capacity = 1;
while (capacity < initialCapacity)
    capacity <<= 1;

So for initialCapacity=1, capacity remains 1. So table.length can be 1, which is a power of two.

So the check for table.length being a power of two is correct.

Next, threshold == (int)(table.length * loadFactor). But due to integer division, this might not hold exactly, but in the constructor and resize, it's set that way. So in a valid state, it should hold.

But wait, in the constructor, threshold is set as (int)(capacity * loadFactor). So for example, if capacity is 16 and loadFactor is 0.75, threshold is 12. So in the repOK, we should check that threshold == (int)(table.length * loadFactor).

But wait, what if the multiplication causes a float that's slightly higher due to precision? For example, 16 * 0.75 is exactly 12, but what if it's 16 * 0.7500001f, which would be 12.0000016, which when cast to int is 12. So perhaps the check is okay.

So in code:

if (threshold != (int)(table.length * loadFactor)) {
    return false;
}

But wait, in the resize method, when the new capacity is set, threshold is recalculated as (int)(newCapacity * loadFactor). So in a valid state, this should hold.

Next, size must be >=0 and <= threshold.

Also, size must be <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

modCount must be >=0.

So putting it all together, the repOK method would look like:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) {
        return false;
    }
    int tableLength = table.length;
    if ((tableLength & (tableLength - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (threshold != (int)(tableLength * loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size < 0 || size > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY || size > threshold) {
        return false;
    }
    if (loadFactor <= 0 || Float.isNaN(loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (modCount < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but in the constructor, the loadFactor is checked to be >0 and not NaN. So perhaps in repOK, we can skip checking loadFactor, but it's safer to include it.

Alternatively, perhaps the loadFactor is already validated in the constructor, but if someone modifies the loadFactor field directly, it could become invalid. So including the check in repOK is better.

Another point: the Entry objects in the table can be null, which is allowed. So no need to check for null entries in the table.

Also, the size should not be negative, which is checked.

Another thing: the threshold should not exceed the table length. Because threshold is (int)(table.length * loadFactor), and loadFactor is positive, so threshold should be <= table.length.

Wait, no: if loadFactor is greater than 1, then threshold could be larger than table.length. But in the constructor, the loadFactor is checked to be >0, but not necessarily <=1. So in the repOK, perhaps we should ensure that threshold <= table.length.

Wait, but in the resize method, when the size exceeds threshold, the table is resized. So if threshold is larger than table.length, that would cause the table to be resized when adding entries beyond table.length, which is not correct. So perhaps the repOK should include a check that threshold <= table.length.

Wait, no: the threshold is the point at which the table will be resized. So if the loadFactor is 2, then threshold would be 2 * table.length, which is larger than table.length. But in that case, the table would only resize when the size exceeds 2*table.length, which is not correct because the table's capacity is table.length, so the maximum size before resizing should be table.length.

Wait, perhaps the loadFactor is intended to be between 0 and 1. So in the repOK, perhaps we should also check that loadFactor is between 0 and 1, inclusive.

But the constructor allows any positive loadFactor, including those greater than 1. So perhaps the repOK should not enforce that, but in practice, a loadFactor greater than 1 would cause the threshold to be larger than the table's capacity, leading to the table not resizing until the size exceeds that, which could cause performance issues but is still a valid state.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the repOK should only check the necessary conditions that are critical for the correctness of the data structure, not the optimal performance.

So, to sum up, the repOK method should check:

- table is not null.
- table.length is a power of two.
- threshold is equal to (int)(table.length * loadFactor).
- size is between 0 and MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, and size <= threshold.
- loadFactor is positive and not NaN.
- modCount is non-negative.

So the code would be as I wrote earlier.

        return false;
    }
    int tableLength = table.length;

        return false;
    }
    if (threshold != (int)(tableLength * loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size < 0 || size > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY || size > threshold) {
        return false;
    }
    if (loadFactor <= 0 || Float.isNaN(loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (modCount < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
