Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class. The representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only include properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the HashMap class and its fields. The fields include table (an array of Entries), size, threshold, loadFactor, and modCount. 

The constructor initializes the table, size, threshold, and loadFactor. The table is an array of Entries, which are created with hash, key, value, and next pointers. 

I remember that in HashMap, the size should always be consistent with the number of entries in the table. So, if the table has N entries, the size should be N. Also, each Entry should have a next pointer that either points to another Entry or null.

Another important aspect is the modCount field, which is used for detecting concurrent modifications. It should be incremented each time a structural modification (like put, remove, or clear) is performed. So, modCount should always be equal to the number of modifications that have been made.

The threshold is the initial capacity multiplied by the load factor. It's used to determine when to resize the table. The table's length should never exceed the maximum capacity, which is 1 << 30.

I should also check that the table's length is a power of two because the initial capacity is set by doubling until it reaches the initial capacity. This ensures efficient hashing.

So, the repOK method should verify the following:

1. The size is equal to the number of non-null entries in the table.
2. Each Entry's next pointer correctly links the entries in the bucket.
3. modCount is equal to the number of times structural modifications have been performed.
4. The table's length is a power of two and does not exceed the maximum capacity.
5. The threshold is correctly calculated based on the initial capacity and load factor.

I'll structure the repOK method to check each of these conditions. If any condition fails, the method returns false, indicating the object is invalid.

I need to make sure that all these checks are efficient and correctly implemented. For example, to check the size, I'll loop through the table and count the non-null entries. For the next pointers, I'll traverse each linked list in the table to ensure they form a valid structure.

For modCount, I'll compare it to the number of structural modifications tracked elsewhere, but since modCount is volatile, I can directly check it in repOK.

Finally, I'll ensure that the table length is a power of two by checking that (table.length & (table.length - 1)) == 0 and that it doesn't exceed MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks and return true only if all are satisfied.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check size consistency
    int expectedSize = 0;
    for (Entry e : table) {
        if (e != null) {
            expectedSize++;
        }
    }
    if (size != expectedSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check next pointers consistency
    for (Entry e : table) {
        Entry next = e.next;
        while (next != null) {
            if (next.hash != e.hash || !eq(e.key, next.key)) {
                return false;
            }
            next = next.next;
        }
    }

    // Check modCount consistency
    if (modCount != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check table size is power of two and within limits
    if ((table.length & (table.length - 1)) != 0 || table.length > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
