Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. Let me first understand what a representation invariant is. From what I remember, it's a method that checks whether the current state of the object is consistent with its invariants. So, for the BinomialHeap, I need to ensure that all the heap properties are maintained correctly.

Looking at the BinomialHeap class, it's a bit complex. It uses a structure where each node has a key and a degree. The heap is managed through insert, delete, and extract operations. The key operations involve maintaining the heap's structure, which is based on the degree of each node.

First, I should think about what invariants are present in the BinomialHeap. From the code, I see that each node has a degree, which is the number of children plus one. The heap is built such that each parent has a key less than its children. Also, the structure is maintained through merging and splitting nodes.

So, the invariants I need to check are:

1. **No Duplicates**: Each key should be unique in the heap.
2. **Ordering**: Each node's key should be less than its parent's key.
3. **Structure Integrity**: The tree structure should be maintained correctly, ensuring that each node's parent, sibling, and child relationships are accurate.
4. **Consistent Degree**: Each node's degree should be correctly set based on its position in the tree.

Now, how to translate these into a method. The repOK method should return true if all invariants are satisfied and false otherwise.

Let me start by checking if the size is correct. The size is maintained through the insert and delete operations, so I can verify that the size matches the actual count of nodes.

Next, I need to ensure that there are no duplicates. I can do this by traversing all nodes and checking if any two nodes have the same key.

For the ordering, I need to check that each node's key is less than its parent's key. I can traverse the tree, starting from the root, and for each node, check its parent.

Regarding the structure, I need to ensure that each node's parent, sibling, and child are correctly set. This involves checking that each node's parent is correctly assigned and that siblings are properly linked.

Additionally, I should check the degree of each node. The degree is the number of children plus one (the parent). So, for each node, I can count its children and ensure that the degree matches.

Putting this all together, the repOK method will perform the following checks:

1. **Size Check**: Ensure the size reported by the heap matches the actual number of nodes.
2. **No Duplicates**: Traverse all nodes and check for duplicate keys.
3. **Ordering Check**: For each node, verify that its key is less than its parent's key.
4. **Structure Check**: Ensure each node's parent, sibling, and child are correctly set.
5. **Degree Check**: For each node, verify that its degree is correct based on its position in the tree.

Now, I'll think about how to implement each of these checks in Java.

For the size check, I can compare the size variable with the number of nodes in the tree. The size is maintained in the BinomialHeap class, so I can get it directly.

To check for duplicates, I'll need to traverse all nodes. Starting from the root, I'll recursively check each node's left and right children, adding each key to a set. If any key is added more than once, there's a duplicate.

For the ordering check, I'll traverse each node and compare its key with its parent's key. If any node's key is not less than its parent's, the ordering is violated.

The structure check involves verifying the parent, sibling, and child relationships. For each node, I'll check if its parent is correctly set and if its sibling and child are as expected.

The degree check involves counting the number of children each node has and ensuring that the degree (number of children + 1) is correct.

I also need to handle cases where the heap is empty or has only one node, as these are edge cases.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks in a systematic way, ensuring that all invariants are maintained.

To ensure the correctness of the BinomialHeap class, we need to verify several invariants. These invariants ensure that the heap's structure, ordering, and uniqueness of keys are maintained. Here's the implementation of the `repOK` method for the BinomialHeap class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the size is correct
    if (size != numNodes(root)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check for duplicates
    Set<Integer> seenKeys = new HashSet<>();
    if (!noDuplicates(root, seenKeys)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check ordering: each node's key must be less than its parent's key
    if (!isOrdered(root)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check structure: parent, sibling, and child relationships
    if (!isStructureValid(root)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check degrees: each node's degree must be correct
    if (!allDegreesCorrect(root)) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private boolean numNodes(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + numNodes(node.left) + numNodes(node.right);
}

private boolean noDuplicates(BinomialHeapNode root, Set<Integer> seenKeys) {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (seenKeys.contains(root.info)) {
        return false;
    }
    seenKeys.add(root.info);
    return noDuplicates(root.left, seenKeys) && noDuplicates(root.right, seenKeys);
}

private boolean isOrdered(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    return isOrderedHelper(node, -1, -1);
}

private boolean isOrderedHelper(BinomialHeapNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if ((min != -1 && node.info <= min) || (max != -1 && node.info >= max)) {
        return false;
    }
    boolean leftOK = true;
    if (node.left != null) {
        leftOK = isOrderedHelper(node.left, min, node.info);
    }
    boolean rightOK = true;
    if (node.right != null) {
        rightOK = isOrderedHelper(node.right, node.info, max);
    }
    return leftOK && rightOK;
}

private boolean isStructureValid(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check parent
    if (node.parent != null && node.parent != node) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check siblings
    if (node.sibling != null) {
        BinomialHeapNode sibling = node.sibling;
        if (sibling.parent != node) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check children
    if (node.child != null) {
        BinomialHeapNode child = node.child;
        if (child.parent != node) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return isStructureValid(node.left) && isStructureValid(node.right);
}

private boolean allDegreesCorrect(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int expectedDegree = (node.child != null) ? 1 + numChildren(node.child) : 1;
    if (node.degree != expectedDegree) {
        return false;
    }
    return allDegreesCorrect(node.left) && allDegreesCorrect(node.right);
}

private int numChildren(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + numChildren(node.left) + numChildren(node.right);
}
```

This method `repOK` performs the following checks:

1. **Size Check**: Verifies that the number of nodes in the heap matches the size reported by the heap.
2. **No Duplicates**: Ensures that each key is unique by checking against a set of seen keys.
3. **Ordering Check**: Confirms that each node's key is less than its parent's key, maintaining the heap's order.
4. **Structure Check**: Validates the integrity of the tree structure, ensuring correct parent, sibling, and child relationships.
5. **Degree Check**: Ensures that each node's degree (number of children + 1) is correct based on its position in the tree.

By systematically checking these invariants, the `repOK` method ensures that the BinomialHeap class maintains its structural and operational invariants, thus guaranteeing the correctness of its operations.
