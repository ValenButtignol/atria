To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. The representation invariant is a boolean method that checks if the object's state is valid. It should return `true` if the object is valid and `false` otherwise. The invariant should only verify properties that we are completely sure are valid.

### Approach
The BinomialHeap class is a type of heap that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. It uses a structure where each node has a key and a degree, and nodes are linked in a specific way to maintain the heap properties. The key operations include inserting elements, deleting elements, and finding the minimum element.

To write the representation invariant, we need to ensure that:
1. The heap is properly structured, meaning each node's key is greater than its parent's key.
2. The heap is acyclic, meaning there are no cycles in the structure of the nodes.
3. The heap maintains the correct order of keys.
4. There are no duplicate keys in the heap.

The invariant will check these properties by traversing the heap and ensuring that each node's key is greater than its parent's key, the structure is acyclic, the order is maintained, and there are no duplicates.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size == 0)
        return true;

    if (Nodes == null)
        return false;

    if (!isAcyclic(Nodes))
        return false;

    if (!isOrdered(Nodes))
        return false;

    if (!hasNoDuplicates(Nodes))
        return false;

    return true;
}

private boolean isAcyclic(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null)
        return true;

    if (node.sibling != null && !isAcyclic(node.sibling))
        return false;

    return isAcyclic(node.parent) && isAcyclic(node.sibling);
}

private boolean isOrdered(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null)
        return true;

    if (node.parent != null && node.key <= node.parent.key)
        return false;

    return isOrdered(node.left) && isOrdered(node.right);
}

private boolean hasNoDuplicates(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    if (node == null)
        return true;

    if (node.findANodeWithKey(node.key) != null)
        return false;

    return hasNoDuplicates(node.left) && hasNoDuplicates(node.right);
}
```

### Explanation
1. **isAcyclic Method**: This method checks if the heap is acyclic by recursively checking each node's parent and sibling. If any node forms a cycle, the method returns `false`.

2. **isOrdered Method**: This method ensures that each node's key is greater than its parent's key. It recursively checks the left and right children of each node to maintain the order.

3. **hasNoDuplicates Method**: This method checks for duplicate keys by using the `findANodeWithKey` method. If any duplicate key is found, it returns `false`.

By combining these checks, the `repOK` method ensures that the BinomialHeap is properly structured, acyclic, ordered, and free of duplicates. This invariant guarantees that the heap's state is valid and can be relied upon for further operations.
