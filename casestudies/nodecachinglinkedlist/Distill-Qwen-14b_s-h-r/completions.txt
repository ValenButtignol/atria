Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should return true if the object is valid and false otherwise. Let me look at the class structure and figure out what invariants must hold.

First, the class has several instance variables: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize. I need to ensure that these variables are consistent.

The header is a LinkedListNode that acts as a sentinel. The size represents the number of elements in the list. The cacheSize is the number of nodes currently cached, and maximumCacheSize is the limit for caching.

Looking at the constructor, header is initialized, size is 0, cacheSize is 0, firstCachedNode is null, and maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE.

Now, considering the methods:

- add and remove methods modify the list and the cache.
- createNode uses the cache to reuse nodes when possible.
- addNodeToCache adds a node to the cache if it's not full.
- getNodeFromCache retrieves a cached node, moving it to the front of the cache.

For the repOK method, I need to check that all invariants are maintained after any operation.

Let me think about the possible invariants:

1. The header's previous and next should point to itself, as it's a sentinel node. So, header.getPreviousNode() == header and header.getNextNode() == header.

2. The size should be non-negative and consistent with the actual number of nodes. So, size >= 0.

3. The cacheSize should be between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive. So, 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

4. The firstCachedNode should be null if cacheSize is 0. Also, each cached node's next should point to the next cached node, forming a linked list. So, if firstCachedNode is not null, its next should be the next cached node, and so on, until the end of the cache.

5. Each node in the linked list should either be in use (part of the main list) or in the cache. But since the cache nodes have their value set to null after being cached, we can check that any node in the cache has a null value.

Wait, in the createNode method, when a cached node is reused, its value is set to the new value. When a node is removed, it's added to the cache with its value set to null. So, any node in the cache should have a null value.

So, another invariant: for any node in the cache, node.getValue() == null.

Also, the main list should not contain any nodes that are in the cache. Because once a node is in the cache, it's considered free and should not be part of the active list.

Wait, but when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the main list's nodes are those that are not in the cache. So, for any node in the main list, it should not be in the cache.

But how do I check that? Because the cache is a separate structure. So, perhaps the invariant is that the cache is a proper linked list, and all nodes in the cache have null values.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should check:

- Header is a sentinel node.
- Size is non-negative.
- Cache size is within bounds.
- First cached node forms a valid linked list.
- All cached nodes have null values.
- The main list doesn't contain any cached nodes.

Wait, but checking the main list for cached nodes might be complicated. Maybe it's sufficient to ensure that the cache is correctly maintained and that the main list's nodes are not in the cache.

Alternatively, perhaps the main list's nodes are those that are reachable from the header, excluding the header itself, and none of these nodes are in the cache.

But that might be too involved for the repOK method. Maybe it's better to focus on the cache's invariants and the header.

So, the repOK method will include:

1. Check that header is a sentinel: header.getPrevious() == header and header.getNext() == header.

2. Check that size is non-negative: size >= 0.

3. Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize: 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

4. If firstCachedNode is not null, then cacheSize must be at least 1, and each node in the cache must have a null value.

5. The firstCachedNode's next should point to the next node in the cache, and so on, until the end, which should point to null or the next node is correctly set.

Wait, in the addNodeToCache method, when a node is added to the cache, it's set as the firstCachedNode, and its next is set to the previous firstCachedNode. So, the cache is a linked list where each node's next points to the next cached node, except the last one, which points to null.

So, in repOK, if firstCachedNode is not null, then:

- The firstCachedNode's next should be the next node in the cache.
- All nodes in the cache should have value null.
- The number of nodes in the cache (cacheSize) should match the count when traversing from firstCachedNode.

But traversing the cache in repOK might be too time-consuming, but for the sake of the invariant, perhaps it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that firstCachedNode's next is correctly set, and that each node in the cache has a null value.

Wait, but how do I traverse the cache in repOK? It might be too slow, but for the purpose of the invariant, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant can be written as:

- If firstCachedNode is not null, then cacheSize must be at least 1.
- The firstCachedNode's next must be the next node in the cache, and so on, until the end.
- Each node in the cache has a null value.

But writing this in code would require a loop, which might not be efficient, but for the repOK method, it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are the header, size, cacheSize, and that the firstCachedNode's next is correctly set, and that all cached nodes have null values.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would have:

- Check header's previous and next are itself.
- Check size >=0.
- Check 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.
- If firstCachedNode is not null, then cacheSize must be >0.
- Traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode, ensuring each node's next is the next in the cache, and each node's value is null.
- Also, ensure that the number of nodes in the cache equals cacheSize.

Wait, but how to count the nodes in the cache? That might be necessary to ensure that cacheSize is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant can be written without traversing, but I think it's necessary to at least check the first node's next and value.

But perhaps for brevity, the repOK method can include the following checks:

1. header.getPrevious() == header && header.getNext() == header.

2. size >= 0.

3. 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

4. If firstCachedNode != null, then firstCachedNode.next != null (since it's the first node, its next should be the next cached node, unless cacheSize is 1, in which case next is null).

Wait, no. If cacheSize is 1, firstCachedNode's next should be null.

Wait, in the addNodeToCache method, when a node is added, it's set as firstCachedNode, and its next is set to the previous firstCachedNode. So, when cacheSize is 1, firstCachedNode.next is null.

So, in repOK, if firstCachedNode is not null, then:

- firstCachedNode.getValue() must be null.

- If cacheSize > 1, then firstCachedNode.next must not be null, and the next node must also have value null, and so on.

But writing this in code would require a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that the firstCachedNode's next is correctly set, and that the value is null, and that the cacheSize is consistent.

But perhaps for the purpose of this exercise, the main invariants are the header, size, cacheSize, and that the firstCachedNode's next is correctly set, and that all cached nodes have null values.

So, the repOK method would look something like:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (header.getPrevious() != header || header.getNext() != header) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
        int count = 0;
        while (current != null && count < cacheSize) {
            if (current.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.getNext();
            count++;
        }
        if (current != null) {
            return false; // more nodes than cacheSize
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but in the code, when a node is added to the cache, its next is set to the previous firstCachedNode, and the previous is set to null. So, the cache is a linked list where each node's next points to the next in the cache, except the last one, which points to null.

So, in the repOK method, if firstCachedNode is not null, we need to traverse all cacheSize nodes, each with value null, and the last node's next is null.

So, the code above does that: it loops cacheSize times, checking each node's value is null, and that the next nodes are correctly linked.

If during traversal, any node's value is not null, or if the number of nodes traversed doesn't match cacheSize, it returns false.

Additionally, it checks that the header is a sentinel, size is non-negative, and cacheSize is within bounds.

I think this covers the main invariants.

    if (header.getPrevious() != header || header.getNext() != header) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
        int count = 0;
        while (current != null && count < cacheSize) {
            if (current.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.getNext();
            count++;
        }
        if (current != null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
