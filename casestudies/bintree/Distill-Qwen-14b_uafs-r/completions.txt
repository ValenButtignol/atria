Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Hmm, I remember that a representation invariant is a condition that must always hold true for the data structure to be correct. It's like a contract that ensures the internal state of the object is valid.

Looking at the BinTree class, it has a root node and a size variable. The add method adds nodes recursively, and there's a Node class with left and right pointers and an info field.

First, I should think about what properties the tree must maintain. Since it's a binary tree, each node can have at most two children: left and right. Also, the size variable should accurately reflect the number of nodes in the tree.

So, the repOK method needs to check a few things:

1. The size variable should be non-negative because you can't have a negative number of nodes.
2. The size should correctly represent the actual number of nodes in the tree. If the tree is empty, size should be 0. If there's one node, size should be 1, and so on.
3. The tree structure should be valid. Each node's left and right children should be either null or point to valid nodes. Also, there should be no cycles in the tree, meaning no node should point back to an already existing node, which could cause infinite loops during traversal.

How do I check these in the repOK method?

For the size check, I can compare the size variable with the actual count of nodes. I can traverse the tree starting from the root and count each node. If the count doesn't match the size, something's wrong.

To prevent cycles, I can keep track of the nodes I've visited during the traversal. If I encounter a node that's already been visited, that means there's a cycle, and the invariant should fail.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

- If size is negative, return false.
- If size is zero, ensure the root is null.
- If size is positive, traverse the tree starting from the root.
- During traversal, count each node and check for cycles by using a set to track visited nodes.
- If the count doesn't match the size, return false.
- If any node's left or right child points to a node that's already been visited (except for null), return false.
- Otherwise, return true.

I need to implement this in Java. I'll use a helper method to traverse the tree and count nodes while checking for cycles. I'll also make sure to handle the case where the tree is empty correctly.

Wait, what about the root being null when size is zero? That's already handled in the initial checks. So, the repOK method should cover all these cases.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.

To write a representation invariant for the `BinTree` class, we need to ensure that the internal state of the tree is valid. The invariant should check that the size of the tree is correct, there are no cycles, and the tree structure adheres to the properties of a binary tree.

### Approach
The representation invariant for the `BinTree` class will perform the following checks:

1. **Size Check**: The size of the tree must be non-negative and must match the actual number of nodes in the tree.
2. **Cycle Check**: There should be no cycles in the tree structure. This ensures that each node is visited exactly once during traversal.
3. **Tree Structure Check**: Each node can have at most two children, and the tree must be traversed correctly without any invalid pointers.

The `repOK` method will traverse the tree to count the nodes and check for cycles using a set to track visited nodes. If any of these checks fail, the method returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

### Solution Code

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }

    int nodeCount = 0;
    Set<Node> visitedNodes = new HashSet<>();
    Node current = root;

    while (current != null) {
        if (!visitedNodes.add(current)) {
            return false; // Detected a cycle
        }

        nodeCount++;
        // Visit left child first
        if (current.left != null) {
            if (!visitedNodes.contains(current.left)) {
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                return false; // Left child already visited, cycle detected
            }
        } else {
            // Move to right child if left is null
            if (current.right != null) {
                current = current.right;
            } else {
                current = null; // No more nodes to visit
            }
        }
    }

    return nodeCount == size;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Size Check**: The method first checks if the size is negative, which is invalid. If the size is zero, it ensures the root is null. For positive sizes, it proceeds to count nodes.
- **Cycle Check**: A set is used to track visited nodes. If a node is encountered more than once during traversal, a cycle is detected, and the method returns `false`.
- **Tree Structure Check**: The method traverses the tree, counting nodes and ensuring each node's children are valid and not already visited.

This approach ensures that the `BinTree` class maintains a valid internal state, adhering to the properties of a binary tree.
