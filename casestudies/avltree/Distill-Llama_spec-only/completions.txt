Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the AvlTree class. Let me look at the code and understand what it does.

First, the class has a static final int ALLOWED_IMBALANCE set to 1. That probably means the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level. The root is an AvlNode, which is an inner class. The constructor initializes root to null.

There are methods like insert and remove. Insert takes an integer x and calls insert(x, root). Similarly, remove does the same. So these methods are using recursion to build the tree.

Looking at the private methods, remove seems to handle the actual removal. It checks if the current node is null, then compares x with the element. If x is less than the element, it goes left, else if greater, goes right. If x is equal, it checks if both left and right exist. If so, it takes the minimum from the right subtree and replaces the current element. Otherwise, it moves to the left or right child. After that, it balances the tree.

The balance method is crucial. It checks if the left subtree is taller than the right by more than ALLOWED_IMBALANCE. If so, it rotates or doubles with the left child. Similarly for the right. Then it updates the height.

The insert method is similar but for adding nodes. It creates a new node if the current tree is null, else it goes left or right based on x. Then it balances.

FindMin returns the minimum element by going left until null. The isEmpty checks if root is null.

There are helper methods like height, rotateWithLeft/RightChild, and doubleWithLeft/RightChild. These handle tree rotations and balancing.

The AvlNode class has element, left, right, and height. It's initialized with element, left, and right, and height is set to 0.

So, the AvlTree manages a balanced binary search tree using the AvlNode structure. It enforces balance by rotating and doubling nodes when necessary. The insert and remove methods maintain the balance, ensuring the tree stays within the allowed imbalance.

Key attributes are the root node and the allowed imbalance. Methods include inserting and deleting nodes, finding the minimum, checking if empty, and balancing the tree.

Constraints are that the tree must remain balanced according to the allowed imbalance, and all operations (insert, delete) must maintain this balance.

So, the informal spec should capture these aspects: the tree's purpose, attributes, methods, and balancing constraints.
</think>

The AvlTree class manages a balanced binary search tree using the AvlNode structure. It enforces balance by rotating and doubling nodes when necessary. The tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level. The root node is the starting point of the tree. The class provides methods to insert and remove nodes, find the minimum element, check if the tree is empty, and maintain balance through rotations and doublings. The AvlNode inner class represents individual nodes with element, left, right, and height attributes. The tree must remain balanced according to the allowed imbalance constraint.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Hmm, I remember that a representation invariant is a method that checks whether the current state of an object is consistent with its invariants. So, for AvlTree, I need to ensure that the tree remains balanced according to the allowed imbalance constraint.

Let me think about what the AvlTree does. It's a balanced binary search tree, but it allows the tree to be imbalanced by one level. That means the height difference between the root and any leaf can't be more than one. So, the invariant should check the heights of the left and right subtrees relative to the root.

The root node has a left and right child. Each node has a height, which is the maximum height of its left and right subtrees plus one. So, for the root, its height should be at most one more than the maximum height of its left and right subtrees. Wait, no, actually, the allowed imbalance is one level, so the root's height can be at most one more than the height of either subtree. Or maybe the other way around: each subtree's height can't differ by more than one from the root's height.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. In an Avl tree, the balance condition is that the height of the left subtree of a node is at most one less than the height of the right subtree, and vice versa. But since the tree allows one level of imbalance, maybe the condition is that the height of the root is at most one more than the height of either subtree.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant should check that for each node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one. But since the tree is built recursively, maybe the root's height is the main thing to check.

Wait, no. The root's height is determined by its left and right subtrees. So, the invariant should ensure that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of either its left or right subtree. Because if the root's height is two more than one of its subtrees, that would mean the tree is imbalanced by two levels, which is not allowed.

So, the method repOK should check that the root's height is at most one more than the height of both its left and right subtrees. Also, it should check that the left and right subtrees themselves satisfy the same condition, recursively.

Wait, but the problem says the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level. So, the root can have a height that's one more than either subtree, but not more than that. So, for the root, its height should be <= max(left height, right height) + 1. Or, more precisely, the root's height should be <= the height of the taller subtree plus one, but not more than that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The allowed imbalance is one level, meaning that the height of the root can be at most one more than the height of the left and right subtrees. So, for the root, its height should be <= the height of the left subtree + 1 and <= the height of the right subtree + 1. But that's not quite right because the left and right subtrees themselves might have their own imbalances.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that for every node, the height of its left subtree is at most one less than the height of its right subtree, and vice versa. But that's more about the balance condition rather than the allowed imbalance.

Wait, the problem says the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level. So, the root can have a height that's one more than the height of either subtree, but not more than that. So, the invariant should check that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of either the left or right subtree.

So, in the repOK method, I need to check:

1. The root is not null.
2. The root's left and right children are either null or AvlNode instances.
3. The height of the root is at most one more than the height of its left subtree.
4. The height of the root is at most one more than the height of its right subtree.
5. The left and right subtrees themselves satisfy the same conditions recursively.

Wait, but the problem says the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level, so the root's height can be at most one more than the height of either subtree. So, the invariant should ensure that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of either left or right.

So, in code terms, for the root:

if (root.height > root.left.height + 1 || root.height > root.right.height + 1) {
    return false;
}

But also, the left and right subtrees must themselves satisfy the same condition. So, recursively, each subtree must have their heights not exceeding the root's height by more than one.

Wait, but the root's height is determined by its left and right. So, perhaps the invariant is that for each node, its height is at most one more than the height of its parent. But since the root has no parent, its height can be any, but the subtrees must not exceed it by more than one.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the height of each node is at most one more than the height of its parent. But since the root's parent is null, that's not applicable.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up the standard representation invariant for Avl trees.

Wait, I recall that in an Avl tree, the height of a node is at most one more than the height of its parent. So, for the root, its height can be any, but each child's height is at most one more than the root's. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The root's height is determined by its children. So, the invariant is that for each node, the height of its left and right children differ by at most one, and the height of each child is at most one more than the height of the node.

Wait, perhaps the invariant is that for every node, the height of its left child is at most one less than the height of its right child, and vice versa. But that's more about the balance condition rather than the allowed imbalance.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the height of the root is at most one more than the height of the left and right subtrees. So, in the repOK method, we check that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of either left or right.

Additionally, we should check that the left and right subtrees themselves satisfy the same condition. So, recursively, each subtree must have its height not exceeding the root's height by more than one.

Wait, but the root's height is determined by its left and right. So, perhaps the invariant is that for the root, its height is <= max(left height, right height) + 1. But that's not quite right because the root's height is already determined by its children.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the steps.

The repOK method should:

1. Check that the root is not null.
2. Check that the root's left and right are either null or AvlNode instances.
3. Check that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of its left subtree.
4. Check that the root's height is not more than one greater than the height of its right subtree.
5. Recursively check the left and right subtrees to ensure they satisfy the same conditions.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check root is not null
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check left and right are either null or AvlNode
    if (root.left != null && !(root.left instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root.right != null && !(root.right instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check root's height is at most one more than left and right
    if (root.height > root.left.height + 1 || root.height > root.right.height + 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right
    return root.left != null && root.left.repOK() &&
           root.right != null && root.right.repOK();
}

Wait, but what if the left or right subtree is null? Then, the height would be -1 or something, but in the code, we have to handle that. So, perhaps we should check if the left or right is null before accessing their heights.

Alternatively, in the AvlNode class, the height is defined as -1 when the node is null. Or perhaps the AvlTree handles nulls as empty trees with height 0.

Wait, in the problem statement, the AvlNode has left, right, and height attributes. So, if a node is null, perhaps its height is considered as -1 or 0. But in the code, when root.left is null, its height would be considered as -1, so root.height > (-1) + 1 would always be true, which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the code to handle nulls properly. So, if a node is null, its height is considered as -1. So, when checking the root's height against the left and right, if the left is null, its height is -1, so root.height > (-1 + 1) => root.height > 0. So, if the root's height is 1, that's allowed because 1 > 0 is true, but that would incorrectly fail the invariant.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps the code should treat null as having a height of 0. Or, better yet, in the repOK method, if a node is null, its height is considered as -1, but when checking, we should consider that a null node's height is -1, and thus, the condition root.height > (left.height + 1) would be root.height > ( -1 + 1 ) => root.height > 0. So, if the root's height is 1, that would be 1 > 0, which is true, but that's incorrect because the root's height can't be more than one greater than the left's height if the left is null.

Wait, perhaps the root's height can be at most one more than the height of the left and right subtrees. So, if the left is null, its height is considered as -1, so the root's height must be <= (-1) + 1 => 0. But that's not correct because a single node (root only) has height 1, which is allowed.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the repOK method should handle nulls by considering their height as -1, but when checking the condition, if the left or right is null, the condition is automatically satisfied because (left.height + 1) would be 0, and the root's height can be at most 1 more than that, which is 1. So, if the root's height is 1, and the left is null, then 1 > 0 is true, which would fail the invariant, but that's incorrect because a single node is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be that the root's height is at most one more than the maximum of the left and right heights. But if one of them is null, their height is considered as -1, so the maximum would be the other subtree's height. So, the root's height must be <= max(left.height, right.height) + 1.

Wait, but if both left and right are null, the root's height is 1, which is allowed. If only one is null, the root's height is at most one more than the non-null subtree's height.

So, in code:

int leftHeight = (root.left != null) ? root.left.height : -1;
int rightHeight = (root.right != null) ? root.right.height : -1;
if (root.height > Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1) {
    return false;
}

But wait, if the root has a left child with height 2 and no right child, then leftHeight is 2, rightHeight is -1. So, max is 2, and root.height must be <= 3. But if the root's height is 3, that's allowed because it's one more than the left's height.

But in the problem statement, the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level, so the root's height can be at most one more than the height of either subtree. So, the condition is correct.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check that the root is not null.
- Check that the left and right children are either null or AvlNode.
- Check that the root's height is not more than one greater than the maximum height of its left and right subtrees.
- Recursively check the left and right subtrees.

So, the code would look something like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check root is not null
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check left and right are either null or AvlNode
    if (root.left != null && !(root.left instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root.right != null && !(root.right instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check root's height is at most one more than the max of left and right heights
    int leftHeight = (root.left != null) ? root.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = (root.right != null) ? root.right.height : -1;
    int maxHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (root.height > maxHeight + 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right
    return (root.left == null || root.left.repOK()) &&
           (root.right == null || root.right.repOK());
}

Wait, but in the problem statement, the tree is allowed to be imbalanced by one level, so the root's height can be at most one more than the height of either subtree. So, the condition is correct.

Also, the recursive part ensures that each subtree also satisfies the same condition. So, if any subtree violates the condition, the repOK returns false.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the repOK method checks the root's height relative to its subtrees and ensures that each subtree also satisfies the condition.
</think>

To ensure the AvlTree remains balanced according to the allowed one-level imbalance, the `repOK` method verifies that the root's height is at most one more than the height of its subtrees and that each subtree adheres to the same condition.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the root is null (empty tree is valid)
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check that left and right children are either null or instances of AvlNode
    if (root.left != null && !(root.left instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root.right != null && !(root.right instanceof AvlNode)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Calculate the heights of left and right subtrees, treating null as height -1
    int leftHeight = (root.left != null) ? root.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = (root.right != null) ? root.right.height : -1;
    int maxHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);

    // Ensure the root's height is at most one more than the maximum height of its subtrees
    if (root.height > maxHeight + 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    return (root.left == null || root.left.repOK()) &&
           (root.right == null || root.right.repOK());
}
```
