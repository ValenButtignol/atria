Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me first understand what this class does. It's a linked list that caches nodes to avoid creating new objects too frequently. When adding a node, if the cache isn't full, it uses a cached node and updates its value. If the cache is full, it creates a new node.

So, the invariant should ensure that the structure of the linked list is maintained correctly. That means each node has a previous and next pointer, and the list is properly linked. Also, the caching logic should be checked to make sure it doesn't break the list structure.

I should think about what could go wrong. For example, when adding a node to the cache, the previous and next pointers of the new node should be set correctly. Also, when removing a node, it should be added back to the cache, and the list should still be intact.

Maybe I can write a method that checks each node in the list to ensure their previous and next pointers are correctly set. Also, I should verify that the cache size doesn't exceed the maximum allowed and that all nodes are properly linked.

Wait, how do I check if the list is properly linked? I can traverse the list and ensure that each node's next pointer points to the correct node, and each node's previous pointer points back correctly. Also, the header node's next should be the first node, and the last node's previous should point back to the header.

Additionally, I should check that the cache isn't overfilled. The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size, and when it's full, adding a new node should create a new node instead of trying to reuse one.

Hmm, I should also ensure that when nodes are added to the cache, their value is updated correctly and that the links don't break. Maybe I can loop through each node and verify their links.

I think the invariant method should do the following checks:
1. Ensure the header node's next is the first node.
2. Ensure the last node's previous is the header.
3. For each node, check that the previous and next pointers are correctly set.
4. Verify that the cache size doesn't exceed the maximum.
5. Ensure that when the cache is full, adding a new node creates a new node instead of reusing an existing one.

Wait, but how do I check if the cache is full correctly? I can check if the cache size is less than the maximum, and if adding a new node would exceed it, then it should create a new node.

I should also make sure that the linked list doesn't have any cycles or invalid pointers that could cause issues.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will traverse the list, check each node's links, ensure the cache isn't overfilled, and verify the structure is consistent.
</think>

To ensure the `NodeCachingLinkedList` maintains its structural integrity and caching constraints, the following representation invariant should be implemented:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header's next is the first node
    if (header.next != firstCachedNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the last node's previous is the header
    if (lastNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check each node's previous and next pointers
    for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
        if (node.previous != header) {
            return false;
        }
        if (node.next == null && node != lastNode()) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check cache size constraints
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if cache is full and new nodes are created correctly
    if (cacheSize == maximumCacheSize) {
        // Ensure that adding a new node creates a new LinkedListNode
        addNodeToCache(newNode());
    }

    return true;
}

private LinkedListNode lastNode() {
    LinkedListNode node = header;
    while (node.next != null) {
        node = node.next;
    }
    return node;
}

private LinkedListNode newNode() {
    return new LinkedListNode();
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Header and Last Node Check:**
   - The header's next should point to the first cached node.
   - The last node in the list should have its previous pointer set to the header, ensuring the list is properly closed.

2. **Node Links Validation:**
   - Traverse each node starting from the header.
   - Ensure each node's previous pointer correctly points to the header.
   - Verify that each node's next pointer either points to the next node or is null (indicating the last node).

3. **Cache Size Constraints:**
   - Ensure the cache size does not exceed the specified maximum cache size.
   - When the cache is full, adding a new node should create a new `LinkedListNode` instance instead of reusing the cache.

This invariant ensures that the linked list structure remains intact, nodes are correctly linked, and caching operations do not violate the maximum cache size constraints.
