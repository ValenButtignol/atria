Alright, I'm trying to write an informal specification for the BinTree class based on the provided Java code. Let me start by understanding what this class does.

From the code, I see that BinTree is a binary tree data structure. It has a private root node and a size variable that keeps track of the number of nodes. The add method is used to insert new nodes into the tree. If the tree is empty (root is null), it creates a new node as the root. Otherwise, it calls addRecursive to insert the new node in the correct position.

Looking at addRecursive, it seems to follow the BST property: for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value. If a node with the given value already exists, it doesn't create a new node.

The getSize method simply returns the size of the tree. There's also a static inner class Node, which defines the structure of each node with left, right pointers, and the node's value.

Now, to write the informal specification, I need to describe the behavior, attributes, and properties of the BinTree class.

First, the behavior: BinTree implements a binary search tree, allowing insertion of nodes and providing the size of the tree. It maintains the BST property.

Attributes: The class has a root node, size, and a Node inner class for individual nodes.

Properties: The tree must maintain the BST property, and the size must accurately reflect the number of nodes.

I should also mention that the add method ensures no duplicate nodes are added.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the specification to cover behavior, attributes, and properties, ensuring it's clear and concise.

### Behavior
The BinTree class represents a binary search tree (BST) data structure. It allows insertion of nodes with unique integer values, maintaining the BST property where each node's value is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree. The class provides methods to add nodes, retrieve the size of the tree, and access individual nodes through a static inner class.

### Attributes
- **root (Node)**: A reference to the root node of the tree. Initially null when the tree is empty.
- **size (int)**: An integer counter tracking the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Node (inner class)**: Defines the structure of each node, containing:
  - **left (Node)**: Pointer to the left child node.
  - **right (Node)**: Pointer to the right child node.
  - **info (int)**: The integer value stored in the node.

### Properties
- **BST Property**: For every node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
- **Size Consistency**: The size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Unique Values**: Each node contains a unique value; duplicates are not allowed.
- **Acyclic Structure**: The tree maintains a valid, non-cyclic structure.

### Methods
- **add(int x)**: Inserts a new node with value x into the tree, maintaining the BST property.
- **getSize()**: Returns the current number of nodes in the tree.
- **Node Inner Class**: Defines the structure of individual tree nodes.

This specification ensures that the BinTree class functions correctly as a BST, supporting efficient insertion and size retrieval while maintaining structural integrity.

Alright, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Let's start by understanding what a representation invariant is. It's a condition that must always hold true for the class to function correctly. It's like a contract that the class must maintain at all times.

First, I'll look at the BinTree class's attributes. There's a root node, which can be null if the tree is empty. Then there's the size, which keeps track of the number of nodes. The inner Node class holds the data, left and right children.

Now, the properties mentioned are crucial. The BST property says that for every node, all left descendants have smaller values, and all right descendants have larger values. Size consistency means the size accurately reflects the number of nodes. Unique values are important too, so no duplicates. And the structure must be acyclic, meaning no loops or cycles in the tree.

I need to translate these properties into a method that checks if the tree is in a valid state. Let's think about how to verify the BST property. I'll need to traverse the tree and ensure that for each node, the left subtree has smaller values and the right has larger ones.

Maybe I can write a helper method that recursively checks each node. Starting from the root, I'll check if the left child (if any) has a value less than the current node's value. Similarly, the right child should have a value greater than the current node's value. I'll need to make sure that this holds true for all nodes in the tree.

Next, I'll check the size consistency. I can compare the size attribute with the actual count of nodes. I'll traverse the tree and count the nodes to ensure it matches the size.

For unique values, I'll need to ensure that no two nodes have the same value. I can keep track of the values I've seen and check each new node against this set. If I find a duplicate, the tree is invalid.

Lastly, the acyclic structure. Since it's a BST, it should naturally be acyclic because each node's children are either smaller or larger, preventing loops. But maybe I should still verify that there are no cycles, perhaps by checking that each node's parent is correctly set.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks: BST property, size consistency, unique values, and acyclic structure. If any of these checks fail, repOK should return false; otherwise, it returns true.

I should also handle edge cases, like an empty tree where root is null and size is zero. In such cases, all other checks should pass trivially.

Now, let's think about how to implement each check. For the BST property, I'll write a helper method that takes a node and its expected bounds (min and max values). Starting with the root and no bounds, each left child must be less than the parent and greater than negative infinity, and each right child must be greater than the parent and less than positive infinity. Recursively, this will ensure the BST property holds throughout the tree.

For size consistency, I'll write another helper method to count the nodes. Starting from the root, if it's null, return zero. Otherwise, return one plus the count of left and right subtrees.

For unique values, I'll use a Set to keep track of seen values. As I traverse the tree, I'll add each node's value to the set and check if it already exists. If it does, return false.

For acyclic structure, since it's a BST, this should inherently be true. But to be thorough, I'll check that each node's parent is correctly set, ensuring there are no cycles.

Finally, I'll combine all these checks in the repOK method. If any check fails, return false; otherwise, return true.

I think this approach covers all the necessary properties and ensures the BinTree remains a valid BST with consistent size, unique values, and acyclic structure.

To write a representation invariant for the `BinTree` class, we need to ensure that the class maintains its properties at all times. The `BinTree` class represents a binary search tree (BST), which has specific structural and behavioral constraints. Below is the step-by-step explanation and the final `repOK` method.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **BST Property**: For every node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
2. **Size Consistency**: The `size` attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the tree.
3. **Unique Values**: Each node contains a unique value; duplicates are not allowed.
4. **Acyclic Structure**: The tree maintains a valid, non-cyclic structure.

### `repOK` Method Implementation

The `repOK` method checks if all the properties of the `BinTree` class are maintained. It performs the following checks:

1. **BST Property Check**: Ensures that each node's value is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.
2. **Size Consistency Check**: Verifies that the `size` attribute matches the actual count of nodes in the tree.
3. **Unique Values Check**: Ensures that all node values are unique.
4. **Acyclic Structure Check**: Verifies that the tree structure is acyclic.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check BST property
    if (!checkBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size consistency
    if (getSize() != countNodes()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check unique values
    if (!checkUniqueValues(root, new HashSet<>())) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check acyclic structure (implicitly satisfied by BST properties)
    return true;
}

private boolean checkBST(Node node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    if (node.info <= min) {
        return false;
    }

    if (node.info >= max) {
        return false;
    }

    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.info) && checkBST(node.right, node.info, max);
}

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }

    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

private boolean checkUniqueValues(Node node, Set<Integer> seen) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    if (seen.contains(node.info)) {
        return false;
    }

    seen.add(node.info);

    return checkUniqueValues(node.left, seen) && checkUniqueValues(node.right, seen);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **BST Property Check**:
   - The `checkBST` method is a recursive helper that verifies the BST property for each node. It ensures that each node's value is within the specified bounds (`min` and `max`). For the root node, the initial bounds are `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. For each left child, the maximum value is updated to the parent's value, and for each right child, the minimum value is updated to the parent's value.

2. **Size Consistency Check**:
   - The `countNodes` method recursively counts the number of nodes in the tree. It returns `0` if the tree is empty and `1` plus the counts of the left and right subtrees otherwise. This count is then compared with the `size` attribute to ensure consistency.

3. **Unique Values Check**:
   - The `checkUniqueValues` method uses a set to track seen values. As it traverses the tree, it checks if a node's value is already in the set. If a duplicate is found, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it adds the value to the set and continues the traversal.

4. **Acyclic Structure Check**:
   - In a BST, the structure is inherently acyclic because each node's children are either smaller or larger, preventing loops. Therefore, this check is implicitly satisfied and does not require explicit verification.

By combining these checks, the `repOK` method ensures that the `BinTree` class maintains its properties and functions correctly as a binary search tree.
