Here's the representation invariant for the AvlTree class as a Java method called `repOK`:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return repOK(root);
}

private boolean repOK(AvlNode t) {
    if (t == null) {
        return true;
    }

    if (t.left != null && t.left.element >= t.element) {
        return false;
    }

    if (t.right != null && t.right.element <= t.element) {
        return false;
    }

    if (Math.abs(height(t.left) - height(t.right)) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    return repOK(t.left) && repOK(t.right);
}
```

This method checks the following properties:

1.  If the tree is empty, it is valid.
2.  For each non-null node, its left child's element is less than its own element, and its right child's element is greater than its own element.
3.  For each non-null node, the absolute difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees does not exceed the allowed imbalance.

These properties ensure that the tree is a valid AVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree with a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1 for each node.
