Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class in Java. Representation invariants are crucial because they ensure that the internal state of the object remains consistent and correct according to the data structure's properties. 

First, I'll look at the structure of the BinomialHeap. It's composed of BinomialHeapNode objects linked together. Each node has a key, degree, parent, sibling, and child. The heap is represented as a collection of trees, each of which is a binomial tree.

One of the key properties of a binomial heap is that for any node, the degree of the node (which represents the height of the tree) is equal to the number of consecutive null children starting from that node. So, for a node with degree d, the next d siblings must have the same degree, and the (d+1)th sibling must have a higher degree. This ensures the structure maintains the correct order.

Another important aspect is the size of the heap. The size should be the sum of the sizes of all the trees in the heap. Each tree's size is calculated recursively, considering its own size and the sizes of its subtrees.

Looking at the code, the size is maintained in each BinomialHeapNode. So, the invariant should check that the size of the entire heap (Nodes.size()) is equal to the sum of the sizes of all the individual trees.

Also, the heap should not have any cycles or invalid tree structures. Each tree must be properly linked with parent, child, and sibling pointers.

Putting this together, the representation invariant should verify that the size of the heap is correct by summing the sizes of all the trees and ensuring that each tree adheres to the degree property.

So, the repOK method should check that the size of the heap (size) is equal to the sum of the sizes of all the trees in the heap. It should also ensure that each tree's structure is valid according to the degree and sibling properties.

I'll write the repOK method to perform these checks. It will calculate the expected size by summing the sizes of all BinomialHeapNode instances and compare it to the heap's size. Additionally, it will verify that each node's degree correctly reflects the structure of its tree.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    int expectedSize = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        expectedSize += current.size();
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    if (expectedSize != size) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Size mismatch: expected " + expectedSize + ", got " + size);
    }
    
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current != current.parent) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid parent relationship");
        }
        if (current != current.child) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid child relationship");
        }
        if (current != current.sibling) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid sibling relationship");
        }
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
