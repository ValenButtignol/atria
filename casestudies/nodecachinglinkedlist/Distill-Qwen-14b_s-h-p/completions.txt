Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariants for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me start by understanding what the class does. It's a linked list that caches nodes to improve performance, especially for frequently accessed elements. The class has several private fields like header, size, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize, firstCachedNode, and DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE.

First, I'll look at the constructor. It initializes the header, sets size to 0, cacheSize to 0, firstCachedNode to null, and sets maximumCacheSize to the default value of 20. So, the initial state has no nodes and an empty cache.

Now, I need to think about the invariants. An invariant is a condition that must always hold true for the object to be valid. Let's go through each field and see what conditions must be met.

1. The header node should always be a sentinel node. Looking at the constructor, it creates a new LinkedListNode with value null and previous and next pointing to itself. So, the header's previous and next should always point to itself. That's one invariant.

2. The size of the linked list must be non-negative. Since size is initialized to 0 and only incremented or decremented in addNode and removeNode methods, it should never go below 0. So, size >= 0 is another invariant.

3. The cache size should also be non-negative and not exceed the maximum allowed size. The cacheSize starts at 0, can increase up to maximumCacheSize, and can decrease when nodes are removed from the cache. So, 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize is another invariant.

4. The maximumCacheSize should be at least as large as the default value, which is 20. Wait, no, the default is set as 20, and the maximumCacheSize is initialized to that. But in the code, maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is 20. So, the maximumCacheSize should be >= DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE? Or is it that it can't be less than the default? Wait, looking at the code, the default is 20, and maximumCacheSize is set to that. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize >= DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. But wait, in the code, maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT, so maybe it's allowed to be equal or larger. Or perhaps it's that maximumCacheSize is always >= 0, but that's already covered by the cacheSize invariant. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The maximumCacheSize is a parameter that can be set, but in the constructor, it's set to the default. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is at least as large as the default. Or maybe that it's a positive integer. Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is >= cacheSize, but that's not necessarily true because cacheSize can be less than maximumCacheSize. Wait, no, because cacheSize can be up to maximumCacheSize. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize >= 0, but that's already covered by the cacheSize invariant. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The maximumCacheSize is initialized to 20, and in the addNodeToCache method, it checks if the cache is full using isCacheFull(), which returns true if cacheSize >= maximumCacheSize. So, the maximumCacheSize can be set, but in the constructor, it's set to the default. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is >= DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. Or maybe it's that maximumCacheSize is >= 0. I think the latter is more general, so 0 <= maximumCacheSize is an invariant.

Wait, but in the code, maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT, which is 20, and there's no method to change it. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is equal to the default. But that might not be the case if someone modifies it elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is a positive integer, but since it's initialized to 20, which is positive, that's covered.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other invariants. Let's think about the header node. The header's next and previous should always point to itself. Because in the constructor, it's created with previous and next as this. So, header.previous == header and header.next == header is an invariant.

Another invariant could be that the size of the list is equal to the number of nodes that are not cached. Wait, no, because the cached nodes are still part of the list but their values are null. Or perhaps the size is the number of nodes in the list, regardless of whether they're cached or not. So, the size should always be correct.

Wait, perhaps the size is always equal to the number of non-null values in the list. Because when a node is cached, its value is set to null. So, the size counts all nodes, including those with null values. So, the size is the total number of nodes, whether they're active or cached.

Another invariant could be that the firstCachedNode is either null or points to a node that is in the cache. So, if firstCachedNode is not null, then the node's previous and next pointers are set correctly within the cache.

Wait, but perhaps that's too detailed. Let me think of the main invariants based on the fields.

So far, I have:

- header.previous == header
- header.next == header
- size >= 0
- 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize
- maximumCacheSize >= 0

Wait, but maximumCacheSize is initialized to 20, and in the code, it's not modified elsewhere. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is equal to the default value. But that's not necessarily true if someone changes it. Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is a positive integer, which it is.

Wait, but in the code, maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT, which is 20, and there's no method to change it. So, perhaps the invariant is that maximumCacheSize is equal to DEFAULT. But that's more of an implementation detail than an invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the cacheSize cannot exceed maximumCacheSize. Which is already covered by the condition in isCacheFull(). So, 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize is an invariant.

Another possible invariant is that the firstCachedNode's next node is either null or points to another cached node. Because when a node is added to the cache, it's linked to the firstCachedNode. So, the structure of the cache is a linked list where each node's next points to the next cached node, and previous points to the previous one.

Wait, but perhaps that's too detailed. Let me think of the main invariants based on the fields and their relationships.

So, to summarize, the main invariants I can think of are:

1. The header node's previous and next always point to itself.
2. The size is always non-negative.
3. The cache size is always between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive.
4. The maximumCacheSize is always non-negative.
5. The firstCachedNode is either null or points to a node that is in the cache.

Wait, but the fifth point might be more of a structural invariant rather than a field-based one. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to focus on the fields and their relationships.

Wait, perhaps the fifth point can be rephrased as: if firstCachedNode is not null, then its previous is null and its next points to the next cached node. But that might be too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the firstCachedNode is the first node in the cache, and each subsequent node in the cache has a previous node pointing to the previous one.

But perhaps it's better to stick to the field values rather than the structure.

So, considering all this, I think the five invariants I can confidently list are:

- Header's previous and next point to itself.
- Size is non-negative.
- Cache size is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- Maximum cache size is non-negative.
- First cached node is either null or its value is null (since cached nodes have their values set to null when added to the cache).

Wait, looking at the code, when a node is added to the cache, its value is set to null in the addNodeToCache method. So, for a node to be in the cache, its value must be null. So, another invariant could be that if a node is in the cache, its value is null.

But how to express that as a field-based invariant? It's more of a structural invariant about the nodes rather than the fields of the class.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that any node in the cache has a value of null. But that's more about the nodes than the class's fields.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to focus on the class's fields rather than the nodes. So, perhaps the five invariants I can list are:

1. Header's previous and next point to itself.
2. Size is non-negative.
3. Cache size is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
4. Maximum cache size is non-negative.
5. First cached node is either null or its value is null.

Wait, but the fifth point is about the nodes, not the class's fields. So, perhaps it's not directly expressible as a field-based invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the firstCachedNode is either null or its previous is null. Because in the cache, the first node's previous is null, and the next points to the next cached node.

But again, that's more about the structure of the cache.

I think I'll stick to the field-based invariants. So, the five properties I can confidently list are:

- Header's previous and next point to itself.
- Size is non-negative.
- Cache size is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- Maximum cache size is non-negative.
- First cached node is either null or its next node is part of the cache.

Wait, but that's still about the structure. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant is that the size of the linked list is equal to the number of nodes that are not in the cache. Because when a node is removed from the list, it's added to the cache with a null value. So, the size counts all nodes, including those in the cache.

Wait, but in the code, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the size is decremented when a node is removed, but the cache size is incremented. So, the total number of nodes is size + cacheSize? Or is the size the number of active nodes, and cacheSize is the number of nodes that are inactive but cached.

Wait, looking at the code:

In the addNode method, when a node is added, size is incremented.

In the removeNode method, size is decremented, and the node is added to the cache, increasing cacheSize.

So, the size represents the number of active nodes, and cacheSize represents the number of inactive nodes that are cached.

So, the total number of nodes created is size + cacheSize.

But perhaps that's not directly relevant to the invariants.

I think I've thought through enough, and I'll list the five invariants based on the fields and their relationships.

- Header's previous and next point to itself.
- Size is non-negative.
- Cache size is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- Maximum cache size is non-negative.
- First cached node is either null or its next node is part of the cache.

Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The user mentioned that the property is a boolean method called `property` which returns true if the object satisfies the invariant, and false otherwise. The specific property given is "header.previous == header".

First, I'll look at the NodeCachingLinkedList class. It has a private LinkedListNode called header. In the constructor, header is initialized with new LinkedListNode(). Looking at the LinkedListNode class, the constructor sets previous and next to this when no arguments are provided. So, for the header node, both previous and next point to itself.

Now, the property is that header.previous should equal header. Since the header is a LinkedListNode, and in its no-arg constructor, previous is set to this, this condition should always hold true. So the method should always return true.

I need to write a method in NodeCachingLinkedList that checks if header.previous is the same as header. So the method will be:

public boolean property() {
    return header.previous == header;
}

This method simply returns true if the invariant holds, which it should always do based on the constructor and the node setup.
</think>

public boolean property() {
    return header.previous == header;
}

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has a LinkedListNode called header. In the constructor, header is initialized with new LinkedListNode(). Looking at the LinkedListNode class, the constructor sets previous and next to this, and value to null. So initially, header's next and previous point to itself.

Now, considering the operations in the class. The add and remove methods modify the linked list. For example, when adding a node, the addNode method is called, which adjusts the previous and next pointers of the nodes involved. Similarly, when removing a node, super_removeNode is called, which also adjusts the links.

The key here is to ensure that the header's next always points back to itself. This is crucial because the linked list is circular. If at any point header.next doesn't equal header, it could mean the list is corrupted, such as having a node removed improperly or not correctly re-linking.

So the representation invariant is that the header's next should always be itself. This ensures the integrity of the circular linked list structure. The property method simply checks if header.next == header and returns the result.

I should write a method in NodeCachingLinkedList that returns this condition. The method will be named `property` as per the instructions.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return header.next == header;
}
```

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class that checks if the size is greater than or equal to zero. 

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has a private int `size` which is initialized to 0 in the constructor. The methods `add` and `remove` modify this size. 

The `add` method calls `addLast`, which in turn calls `addNode`, which increments `size`. The `remove` method calls `removeNode`, which calls `super_removeNode`, decrementing `size`. 

So, the size should always be non-negative. The property method needs to return true if `size >= 0`, which it always should be. 

I'll create a public boolean method `property` that returns `size >= 0`. 

I should make sure the method is correctly placed within the class, after the existing methods. 

So the code will be straightforward: a single line checking the condition.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return size >= 0;
}
```

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class that checks if the cache size is within the valid range. The property should return true if 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize, and false otherwise.

First, I'll look at the class variables. There's a `cacheSize` and `maximumCacheSize`. The `cacheSize` is initialized to 0, and `maximumCacheSize` is set to 20 by default. 

The method needs to be a boolean method. So I'll declare it as `public boolean property()`. 

Inside the method, I'll check two conditions: 
1. That `cacheSize` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. That `cacheSize` is less than or equal to `maximumCacheSize`.

If both conditions are true, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

I should also ensure that this method doesn't modify any state, so it's a pure getter method. 

So putting it all together, the method will return the logical AND of the two conditions.
</think>

public boolean property() {
    return 0 <= cacheSize && cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize;
}

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class that checks if the `maximumCacheSize` is greater than or equal to zero. 

First, I'll look at the class structure. The `maximumCacheSize` is a private int variable. So, the method needs to access this variable. Since it's private, the method can directly access it without any issues.

The method should return a boolean. So, the method will be something like `public boolean property() { ... }`.

The condition is that `maximumCacheSize >= 0`. So, the method will simply return the result of this condition.

I should also consider if there are any edge cases. For example, if `maximumCacheSize` is set to a negative value, the method should return false. If it's zero or positive, it returns true.

Looking at the constructor, the default `maximumCacheSize` is set to 20, which is positive. So, under normal circumstances, this should hold true. But the method needs to check this regardless of how the value was set.

I don't think there are any other considerations here. The method is straightforward.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return maximumCacheSize >= 0;
}
```
