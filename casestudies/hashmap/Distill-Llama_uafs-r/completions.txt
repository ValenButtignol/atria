Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class. The user provided the code for the HashMap, and I have to create a method called repOK that checks if the HashMap's structure is consistent with its invariants.

First, I should understand what the invariants are for a HashMap. From what I know, a HashMap should maintain the following properties:

1. **No duplicates**: Each key should appear at most once.
2. **Order preservation**: The order of insertion is preserved, but in Java, the HashMap does not guarantee order. Wait, no, actually, in Java, the HashMap does not maintain any particular order. So maybe that's not an invariant here.
3. **Capacity constraints**: The size of the HashMap should not exceed the capacity, and the threshold should be respected.
4. **Consistent hashing**: Each key should hash to the same value every time.
5. **Load factor**: The number of elements in the HashMap should not exceed the threshold, which is based on the load factor.

Wait, but in the provided code, the HashMap uses a hash function that's designed to distribute the keys evenly. So the invariant should ensure that each key's hash is correctly computed and that the table is properly structured.

Looking at the code, the key points are:

- The table is an array of Entries.
- The size is the number of entries.
- The threshold is calculated as capacity multiplied by the load factor.
- The modCount is a volatile counter used for fail-fast behavior, but maybe that's not directly an invariant.
- The hash function is static and used to compute the index for each key.

So, the invariants I need to check are:

1. **No duplicates**: Each key is unique.
2. **Load factor compliance**: The number of entries (size) does not exceed the threshold.
3. **Capacity constraints**: The table's length is a power of two and is within the maximum capacity.
4. **Consistent hashing**: Each key's hash is correctly computed and leads to the same bucket.
5. **Fail-fast on structural modifications**: But since modCount isn't directly part of the structure, maybe that's handled elsewhere.

Wait, but the user's previous examples for MinHeap and BinTree included checks for structure, like parent-child relationships and order. For HashMap, the structure is more about the table, size, and hash distribution.

So, for repOK, I need to check:

- The size is correct relative to the threshold.
- The table's length is a power of two and within the maximum capacity.
- Each key's hash correctly maps to its bucket.
- No duplicates exist in the keys.
- The modCount is consistent, but since it's volatile, maybe it's not part of the structural invariant.

Wait, but in the MinHeap example, the repOK method checked the heap structure by ensuring each node's children are correctly placed. For HashMap, it's more about the table's state and key uniqueness.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

1. Check if the size is correct relative to the threshold. If size > threshold, return false.
2. Ensure the table's length is a power of two and within the maximum capacity.
3. Verify that each key's hash correctly maps to the corresponding bucket.
4. Check for duplicates by ensuring each key is unique in the table.
5. Maybe check that the modCount is consistent, but since it's volatile, perhaps it's not necessary here.

Wait, but how do I check for duplicates? I need to ensure that each key appears only once. So, I can iterate through the table and check that each bucket has at most one non-null entry.

Also, the table should be properly initialized, with each entry having a hash, key, value, and next pointer.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check if the table's length is a power of two and within the maximum capacity.
- Ensure the size does not exceed the threshold.
- Verify that each key's hash correctly maps to its bucket.
- Check for duplicates by ensuring each key is unique.
- Maybe check that the table is properly initialized, but that's more of a construction check.

Wait, but in the provided code, the table is initialized in the constructor, so maybe that's not necessary here.

So, the main checks are:

1. Table length is a power of two and <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.
2. Size <= threshold.
3. No duplicates in keys.
4. Each key's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

But how to implement this in code?

For point 1, I can check if the table's length is a power of two by ensuring that (table.length & (table.length - 1)) == 0.

For point 2, compare size with threshold.

For point 3, iterate through the table and check that each bucket has at most one non-null entry.

For point 4, iterate through each entry and ensure that the hash correctly maps to the bucket index.

Wait, but the hash is computed as per the hash function, and the index is determined by indexFor(hash, table.length). So, for each entry, the hash should be such that when indexFor is applied, it points to the correct bucket.

But in the code, the addEntry method ensures that each entry is placed at the correct bucket. So, perhaps the hash function is correct, but I need to ensure that each entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to check that the table's length is correct and that size <= threshold, and that there are no duplicates.

But I'm not sure if that's enough. Maybe I should also check that each entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

So, in the repOK method:

- Check table length is a power of two and <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.
- Check size <= threshold.
- Check for duplicates by ensuring each key is unique.
- Check that each entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

But how to implement the last point? For each entry, compute its hash and see if it maps to the correct bucket.

Alternatively, since the entries are added correctly, maybe it's redundant. But for the repOK, it's better to be thorough.

So, in code:

Loop through each bucket in the table:

- For each non-null entry, check that the entry's hash, when passed to indexFor, equals the bucket index.

If any entry fails this, return false.

Also, check that each key is unique by ensuring that each key appears only once in the table.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would:

1. Check if the table's length is a power of two and <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.
2. Check if size > threshold, return false.
3. Check for duplicates by iterating through the table and ensuring each key is unique.
4. Check that each entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

If all these pass, return true; else, false.

Now, let's think about how to implement each step.

Step 1: Check table length.

int tableLength = table.length;
if ((tableLength & (tableLength - 1)) != 0) {
    return false;
}
if (tableLength > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) {
    return false;
}

Step 2: Check size <= threshold.

if (size > threshold) {
    return false;
}

Step 3: Check for duplicates.

Create a set of keys.

Set<Object> seenKeys = new HashSet<>();
for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e == null) continue;
    Object key = e.getKey();
    if (key == null) continue; // since null is represented as NULL_KEY
    if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
        return false;
    }
    seenKeys.add(key);
}

Wait, but in the code, the key can be null, but it's represented as NULL_KEY. So, in the table, the key is either a real key or NULL_KEY.

So, in the code, the key is stored as either a real key or NULL_KEY. So, when checking for duplicates, we need to treat NULL_KEY as a single unique key.

So, in the code, when adding to the table, if the key is null, it's stored as NULL_KEY. So, in the repOK method, when checking for duplicates, we should consider NULL_KEY as a single entry.

So, in the code:

if (key == NULL_KEY) {
    if (seenKeys.contains(NULL_KEY)) {
        return false;
    }
    seenKeys.add(NULL_KEY);
} else {
    if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
        return false;
    }
    seenKeys.add(key);
}

But in the provided code, the key is stored as either a real key or NULL_KEY. So, in the repOK method, we need to ensure that there's only one NULL_KEY in the table.

So, in code:

int nullKeyCount = 0;
for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e == null) continue;
    Object key = e.getKey();
    if (key == NULL_KEY) {
        nullKeyCount++;
        if (nullKeyCount > 1) {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenKeys.add(key);
    }
}

But wait, in the code, the key is stored as either a real key or NULL_KEY. So, the table can have at most one NULL_KEY.

So, in the repOK method, we need to ensure that there's at most one NULL_KEY in the table.

So, in code:

int nullKeyCount = 0;
for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e == null) continue;
    Object key = e.getKey();
    if (key == NULL_KEY) {
        nullKeyCount++;
        if (nullKeyCount > 1) {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenKeys.add(key);
    }
}

But wait, in the code, the key is stored as either a real key or NULL_KEY. So, the table can have at most one NULL_KEY.

So, in the repOK method, we need to count how many times NULL_KEY appears as a key in the table.

If more than one, return false.

So, that's one part.

Step 4: Check that each entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket.

For each entry in the table:

- Compute its hash.
- Compute the bucket index using indexFor(hash, table.length).
- Ensure that the entry is in the correct bucket.

But how to do this? Because the entries are linked, we need to traverse each entry and check their hash.

Wait, but in the addEntry method, the entries are added to the correct bucket. So, perhaps it's redundant to check again. But for the repOK, it's better to be thorough.

So, in code:

for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e == null) continue;
    int hash = e.hash;
    int bucketIndex = indexFor(hash, table.length);
    if (bucketIndex != arrayIndex) {
        return false;
    }
}

Wait, but how to get the arrayIndex? Because the entry is in the table at some position, but the entry's hash may not correspond to that position.

Wait, no. The entry's hash is computed when the key is added, and the index is determined by indexFor(hash, table.length). So, for each entry, the hash should map to the correct bucket index.

But in the table, the entries are stored in the buckets in a linked list. So, the entry's hash may not directly correspond to its position in the table array.

Wait, no. The table is an array where each index represents a bucket. Each entry in the table is part of a linked list for that bucket. So, the entry's hash is used to compute the bucket index, but the entry itself is part of the linked list in that bucket.

So, to check that the entry's hash correctly maps to its bucket, we need to ensure that for each entry, the hash computed when it was added leads to the correct bucket index.

But since the table is built by the addEntry method, which ensures that each entry is placed in the correct bucket, perhaps this check is redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check that for each entry, the hash correctly maps to its bucket index.

So, in code:

for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e == null) continue;
    int hash = e.hash;
    int bucketIndex = indexFor(hash, table.length);
    if (bucketIndex != arrayIndex) {
        return false;
    }
}

But wait, how to get the arrayIndex? Because the entry is in the table at some position, but the bucketIndex is computed from the hash. So, for each entry, the bucketIndex should equal the index in the table array where the entry is located.

Wait, no. The entry is in the table at a specific index, but the bucketIndex is computed from the entry's hash. So, for each entry, the bucketIndex should equal the index in the table where the entry is located.

Wait, no. The entry is in the table at a specific index, but the bucketIndex is computed from the entry's hash. So, for each entry, the bucketIndex should equal the index in the table where the entry is located.

Wait, that can't be right because the table is an array of buckets, and each bucket can have multiple entries. So, the entry's hash determines which bucket it belongs to, but the entry is stored in the bucket's linked list.

So, perhaps the correct check is to ensure that for each entry, the bucketIndex computed from its hash equals the index in the table where the entry is located.

But that's not directly possible because the entry is part of a linked list within a bucket.

Hmm, maybe this check is not necessary because the addEntry method ensures that each entry is placed in the correct bucket. So, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the table's length is correct, size <= threshold, and no duplicates.

But I'm not entirely sure. The user's previous examples included checks for structure, so perhaps it's better to include this check.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are:

- The table's length is a power of two and within the maximum capacity.
- The size does not exceed the threshold.
- No duplicates in keys.
- The modCount is consistent, but since it's volatile, maybe it's not part of the structural invariant.

So, perhaps the repOK method should check these points.

In code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check table length is a power of two and within maximum capacity
    int tableLength = table.length;
    if ((tableLength & (tableLength - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (tableLength > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size does not exceed threshold
    if (size > threshold) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check for duplicates
    Set<Object> seenKeys = new HashSet<>();
    int nullKeyCount = 0;
    for (Entry e : table) {
        if (e == null) continue;
        Object key = e.getKey();
        if (key == NULL_KEY) {
            nullKeyCount++;
            if (nullKeyCount > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
                return false;
            }
            seenKeys.add(key);
        }
    }

    // Check modCount consistency (if needed)
    // Since modCount is volatile, perhaps it's not part of the structural invariant
    // But for fail-fast behavior, it's important
    // However, since it's not part of the structure, maybe it's not checked here

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the provided code, the modCount is used for fail-fast behavior, but it's not part of the structural state. So, perhaps it's not part of the repOK method.

So, the final repOK method would include the checks for table length, size, and duplicates.

I think that's a reasonable approach.
</think>

To ensure the HashMap class adheres to its structural invariants, the `repOK` method should verify the following:

1. **Table Structure**: The table's length must be a power of two and within the maximum capacity.
2. **Load Factor Compliance**: The number of entries (size) should not exceed the threshold, which is calculated based on the load factor.
3. **No Duplicates**: Each key must be unique, with at most one occurrence of `NULL_KEY`.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check table length is a power of two and within maximum capacity
    int tableLength = table.length;
    if ((tableLength & (tableLength - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (tableLength > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size does not exceed threshold
    if (size > threshold) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check for duplicates
    Set<Object> seenKeys = new HashSet<>();
    int nullKeyCount = 0;
    for (Entry e : table) {
        if (e == null) continue;
        Object key = e.getKey();
        if (key == NULL_KEY) {
            nullKeyCount++;
            if (nullKeyCount > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if (seenKeys.contains(key)) {
                return false;
            }
            seenKeys.add(key);
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

This method ensures that the HashMap's structure is consistent with its design constraints, maintaining the correct table size, load factor adherence, and uniqueness of keys.
