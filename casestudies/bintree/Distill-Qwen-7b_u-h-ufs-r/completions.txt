Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Let me think about what this class does. It's a binary tree, right? So each node can have at most two children. The class has a root node and a size variable that keeps track of the number of nodes.

First, I should consider the basic properties. The size should always be equal to the number of nodes in the tree. So if I traverse all nodes, the count should match the size. That makes sense.

Another thing is that the root should be a Node object. If the tree is empty, the root is null, and the size is zero. That's straightforward.

I also need to ensure that each node has proper left and right children. If a node is not null, its left and right should either be null or point to another Node. Otherwise, there might be invalid nodes in the tree.

Wait, what about the structure of the tree? It should form a proper binary tree, not necessarily a binary search tree. So each node can have zero, one, or two children, but the tree isn't ordered in any particular way.

So, the representation invariant should check a few things:
1. The size is correct, meaning the number of nodes matches the size variable.
2. The root is null if the size is zero.
3. Each node's left and right children are either null or another Node instance.

Let me outline the steps for the repOK method:
- Check if size is negative. If so, return false.
- If size is zero, ensure root is null.
- Otherwise, traverse the tree starting from the root.
- For each node, check that left and right are either null or another Node.
- Also, ensure that the size is exactly the number of nodes in the tree.

I should implement this without using any external libraries, so I'll have to write a helper method or use a loop to count the nodes and check the structure.

Wait, but in the given BinTree class, the Node is a static inner class. So I need to make sure that when I traverse, I'm accessing the left and right fields correctly.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should:
- Verify that size is non-negative.
- If size is zero, root must be null.
- Otherwise, traverse each node and check that left and right are valid.
- Also, count the nodes to ensure it matches the size.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the method accordingly.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    int nodeCount = 0;
    Node current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.left != null && !(current.left instanceof Node)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (current.right != null && !(current.right instanceof Node)) {
            return false;
        }
        nodeCount++;
        current = current.left;
    }
    return nodeCount == size;
}
```
