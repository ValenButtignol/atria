Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Let me think about what a representation invariant is. It's a condition that must always hold true for the data structure to be in a valid state. So, I need to figure out what properties the BinTree must maintain to be considered a valid binary tree.

Looking at the BinTree class, it has a root node and a size. The add method adds nodes recursively, ensuring that each new node is placed correctly according to the BST property. So, the tree should be a binary search tree, meaning for every node, all nodes in its left subtree are less than or equal to its value, and all nodes in its right subtree are greater than or equal to its value.

First, I should check if the tree is a valid BST. That means for each node, its left child (if any) should have a value less than or equal to it, and its right child (if any) should be greater than or equal to it. But wait, in a BST, typically left is less than and right is greater. So maybe I should adjust that.

Also, I need to ensure that there are no duplicate nodes. Each node's value should be unique. So, for any node, its left child's value should be less than it, and the right child's value should be greater than it. That way, duplicates are avoided.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the tree. Each node should have at most one left and one right child. So, the left and right pointers should not be null if they exist, but more importantly, they should point to valid nodes.

So, the representation invariant should check these conditions:
1. The tree is a valid BST.
2. Each node has at most one left and one right child.
3. All nodes have unique values.
4. The size of the tree is correctly maintained.

Let me outline how to check each condition.

For the BST property, I can traverse the tree recursively. Starting from the root, for each node, check that all left descendants are <= current value and right descendants are >= current value. Wait, but in a BST, typically left is less than and right is greater. So maybe I should adjust the conditions to be strictly less than and greater than, depending on whether duplicates are allowed. Looking at the add method, it checks if x is equal to current.info and returns, so duplicates are not allowed. So, the BST should enforce that left children are less than the parent and right children are greater than the parent.

So, for each node, left child must be < current, and right child must be > current.

Next, check that each node has at most one left and one right child. That means, for any node, left and right cannot both be null. Wait, no, a node can have both left and right children. The issue is that a node can't have more than one left or more than one right. So, for each node, it can have a left child or a right child, but not both. Or wait, in a BST, a node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node can have at most one left and one right child, but both can exist.

Wait, no, a node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node has exactly zero, one, or two children, but not more. So, for any node, left and right can be null or non-null, but not both null. Wait, no, a node can be null, but in this case, the root is not null unless the tree is empty.

Wait, the root is null when the tree is empty. So, the invariant is that for each node, if it's not null, it has exactly one left and one right child, but they can be null. So, a node can have a left child, a right child, or both, but not more than that.

So, for each node, the left and right pointers can be null or non-null, but not both null if the tree is not empty. Wait, no, the root can have both left and right children, so the invariant is that each node can have zero, one, or two children, but not more than two.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I need to ensure that if it's not null, it has at most one left and one right child. So, for each node, left and right cannot both be non-null. Wait, no, that's not correct. A node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node can have zero, one, or two children, but not more than two. So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have both left and right children if it's not null.

Wait, no, that's not correct. A node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node can have zero, one, or two children, but not more than two. So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have more than two children. But in practice, each node can have at most two children, so the invariant is that for any node, the number of children is at most two.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have both left and right children if it's not null. Wait, no, that's not correct. A node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node can have zero, one, or two children, but not more than two. So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have more than two children.

Wait, but in the add method, when adding a node, it's added as either left or right, not both. So, each node can have at most two children, but not more than that. So, the invariant is that for any node, the number of children is at most two.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have more than two children.

Additionally, I need to ensure that the tree is a valid BST. So, for each node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater than the node.

Also, the size should be correctly maintained. So, the size should be equal to the number of nodes in the tree.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should:

1. Check that the tree is a valid BST.
2. Check that each node has at most two children.
3. Check that the size is equal to the number of nodes.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, the BST check. I can write a helper method that traverses the tree recursively, ensuring that for each node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater than the node.

Wait, but in the add method, duplicates are not allowed, so the BST should enforce that left children are less than the parent and right children are greater than the parent.

So, the helper method could be something like:

private boolean isBST(Node node, Integer min, Integer max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.info < min) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.info > max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBST(node.left, min, node.info) && isBST(node.right, node.info, max);
}

But wait, initially, the root has no min or max. So, for the root, min would be negative infinity and max would be positive infinity. Then, for the left child, the max becomes the root's value, and for the right child, the min becomes the root's value.

So, the helper method would recursively check each node against its min and max.

But in Java, Integer can be used with null checks, but in this case, min and max can be null initially. Wait, no, in the initial call, min and max are null, so we need to handle that.

Alternatively, we can pass Integer.MIN_VALUE as the initial min and Integer.MAX_VALUE as the initial max for the root.

Wait, but for the root, there's no parent, so min and max are unbounded. So, for the root, min is null and max is null, and for its left child, max becomes the root's value, and for the right child, min becomes the root's value.

So, the helper method could be written as:

private boolean isBSTHelper(Node node, Integer min, Integer max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (min != null && node.info <= min) {
        return false;
    }
    if (max != null && node.info >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBSTHelper(node.left, min, node.info) && isBSTHelper(node.right, node.info, max);
}

Wait, but in the add method, when adding a node, if it's the left child, its value is less than the parent, and if it's the right child, its value is greater than the parent. So, the BST property should hold.

So, the helper method should check that for each node, its value is greater than min and less than max, where min and max are passed down from the parent.

So, the initial call would be isBSTHelper(root, null, null), but wait, no. For the root, there's no min or max, so min and max are null. For the left child of the root, min is null and max is root's value. For the right child, min is root's value and max is null.

Wait, no. For the root, min and max are null. For the left child, min remains null, and max becomes the root's value. For the right child, min becomes the root's value, and max remains null.

So, the helper method should correctly handle these cases.

Next, the invariant that each node has at most two children. So, for each node, the number of non-null children should be <= 2.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that left and right are not both non-null.

Wait, no, a node can have both left and right children. So, the invariant is that each node can have zero, one, or two children, but not more than two.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have more than two children.

So, for each node, if left is not null and right is not null, that's allowed. If only one is not null, that's allowed. If both are null, that's allowed.

So, the invariant is that for any node, the number of non-null children is <= 2.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that left == null || right == null || (left != null && right != null) is allowed.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The invariant is that each node can have at most two children, so the number of non-null children should be <= 2.

So, for each node, if left != null and right != null, that's allowed. If only one is non-null, that's allowed. If both are null, that's allowed.

So, the condition is: (left == null) || (right == null) || (left != null && right != null).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The condition is that the number of non-null children is <= 2. So, for any node, left and right can be null or non-null, but not both non-null if the node is not null.

Wait, no, a node can have both left and right children. So, the condition is that for any node, the number of non-null children is <= 2.

So, during the traversal, for each node, I should check that left and right are not both non-null.
