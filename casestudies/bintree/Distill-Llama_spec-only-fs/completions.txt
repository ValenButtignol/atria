Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the BinTree class. Let me look at the code provided to understand what it does.

First, the BinTree class has a root node and a size counter. The add method takes an integer x and adds it to the tree. If the root is null, it creates a new node with x as the info and increments the size. Otherwise, it calls addRecursive on the root with x.

The addRecursive method is a helper that takes the current node and the value x. It checks if x is equal to the current node's info. If so, it does nothing because the tree is supposed to have unique values. If x is less than the current node's info, it tries to add it to the left subtree. If the left child is null, it creates a new node and increments the size. Otherwise, it recursively calls addRecursive on the left child. If x is greater than the current node's info, it does the same for the right subtree.

The getSize method simply returns the size, which is the number of nodes in the tree.

The Node class is a static inner class with left and right children and an info field. It's initialized with the given info.

So, the behavior of BinTree is that it's a binary search tree (BST) where each node holds an integer, and each node can have a left and right child. The add method ensures that each new node is placed in the correct position according to BST rules, and the size is updated accordingly.

Key attributes are root, which is the starting point of the tree, and size, which tracks the number of nodes. The nodes themselves have info, left, and right attributes.

Constraints include that the tree must maintain the BST property, meaning for every node, all left descendants are less than it, and all right descendants are greater than it. Also, the size must always be a non-negative integer and consistent with the structure of the tree.

So, the informal specification should capture these aspects: the tree's structure, how nodes are added, the size tracking, and the BST property.
</think>

**Informal Specification for the BinTree Class**

**Behavior:**
- The BinTree class represents a binary search tree (BST) that stores unique integer values.
- The tree is structured such that for every node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater than the node.
- The add method inserts a new integer into the tree, ensuring no duplicates, by recursively placing it in the left or right subtree as appropriate.
- The size method returns the total number of nodes in the tree.

**Attributes:**
- root (Node): Reference to the first node in the BST. Initially null.
- size (int): Tracks the number of nodes in the tree. Starts at 0 and increments with each successful add operation.

**Properties:**
- **BST Property:** The tree maintains the BST property where each node's value is greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree.
- **Unique Values:** The tree ensures that each value is unique.
- **Size Consistency:** The size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Non-negative Size:** The size attribute is always a non-negative integer.

**Constraints:**
- The tree must always maintain the BST structure.
- The size must not be negative and must be consistent with the tree's structure.
- Duplicate values cannot be inserted into the tree.

<think>
Alright, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Let me start by understanding what the BinTree class does. It's a binary search tree (BST) that stores unique integer values. Each node in the tree has a value, a left child, and a right child. The add method ensures that no duplicates are added, and the tree maintains the BST property where left descendants are less than the parent and right descendants are greater than the parent.

So, the repOK method should check that the tree adheres to these properties. Let me think about what invariants are necessary.

First, the BST property: For every node, all nodes in the left subtree must be less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree must be greater. So, I need to verify this for all nodes in the tree.

Second, the size must be accurate. The size should reflect the actual number of nodes in the tree. Also, the size shouldn't be negative.

Third, there should be no duplicates. Since the add method is supposed to prevent duplicates, I need to ensure that each value is unique in the tree.

Additionally, the tree should be properly structured. The root should not be null if the size is greater than zero. Also, the left and right children should be correctly positioned based on the BST rules.

Let me outline the steps for the repOK method:

1. Check if the size is negative. If it is, return false.
2. If the size is zero, ensure that the root is null.
3. If the size is greater than zero, ensure that the root is not null.
4. Traverse the tree to check the BST property. For each node, verify that all left descendants are less and all right descendants are greater.
5. Ensure that there are no duplicates by checking that each value is unique.
6. Verify that the tree is properly structured, meaning that the left and right children are correctly placed.

Wait, how do I check for duplicates? One way is to compare each node's value with all other nodes. But that could be inefficient. Maybe during the traversal, I can keep track of the values I've seen and ensure that each new value hasn't been seen before.

Alternatively, since the add method is supposed to prevent duplicates, maybe I can assume that duplicates aren't present unless there's a bug in the add method. But for the repOK method, I need to verify the invariant, so I should include a check for duplicates.

Hmm, but checking for duplicates by comparing each node's value with all others might be too slow for large trees. Maybe there's a better way. Perhaps using a Set to track the values as I traverse the tree. If I encounter a value that's already in the Set, I return false.

Yes, that makes sense. So during the traversal, I'll add each node's value to a Set. If I find a duplicate, the tree violates the invariant.

Now, let's think about the traversal. I'll need to recursively check each node. For each node, I'll check its left and right children to ensure they follow the BST property.

Wait, but in a BST, the left child should be less than the parent, and the right child should be greater. So for each node, I need to ensure that all left descendants are less and all right descendants are greater.

I can write a helper method to check the BST property for a given node. This method will recursively verify the left and right subtrees.

Also, I need to ensure that the tree is a proper BST. For example, if a node's left child is greater than it, that violates the BST property.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the tree. The root should not be null if there are nodes. Also, if the root's left child exists, it should be less than the root, and similarly for the right child.

Let me outline the steps again:

1. Check if size is negative. Return false if so.
2. If size is zero, check that root is null. If not, return false.
3. If size is greater than zero, check that root is not null. If it is, return false.
4. Traverse the tree and check the BST property for each node.
5. Use a Set to track seen values to detect duplicates.
6. Ensure that the tree is properly structured, meaning that the left and right children are correctly placed.

I think that covers the main points. Now, let's think about how to implement this in Java.

The repOK method will be a public boolean method in the BinTree class. It will first check the size. Then, it will perform a traversal of the tree, checking each node's value against its children and ensuring no duplicates.

I'll need a helper method, maybe called checkBST, which takes a Node and checks its left and right children. This method will recursively verify that all left descendants are less and all right descendants are greater.

Also, during the traversal, I'll add each node's value to a Set. If I encounter a value that's already in the Set, I'll return false.

Wait, but the Set will only track the values as we traverse. So, if a duplicate is found, the tree is invalid.

Another consideration: the tree must be a proper BST. For example, the left child of a node should be less than the node, and the right child should be greater. Also, the tree should be complete, but I think that's more of a structural property rather than an invariant. The repOK method is more about the data invariants rather than the structural completeness.

So, focusing on the data invariants: BST property, unique values, size consistency, and non-negative size.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, let's write the code.

First, the repOK method will:

- Check if size is negative.
- If size is zero, check that root is null.
- If size is greater than zero, check that root is not null.
- Then, perform a traversal to check BST property and uniqueness.

I'll use a Set to track the values. For each node, I'll add its value to the Set. If I find a duplicate, return false.

Also, for each node, I'll check that its left child is less than it and its right child is greater than it. If not, return false.

Wait, but the left child's value should be less than the parent, and the right child's value should be greater. So, for each node, I need to ensure that if the left child exists, its value is less than the parent, and similarly for the right child.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Set<Integer> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    return checkBST(root, seenValues);
}

private boolean checkBST(Node node, Set<Integer> seenValues) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    if (seenValues.contains(node.value)) {
        return false;
    }

    seenValues.add(node.value);

    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.value >= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left, seenValues)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.value <= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right, seenValues)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the checkBST method, I'm passing the seenValues Set. However, since Sets are mutable, this could cause issues if multiple threads are accessing the tree. But since this is a single-threaded check, it's okay.

Also, I need to ensure that the size is consistent with the number of nodes. So, during the traversal, I can count the number of nodes and compare it with the size.

Yes, that's a good point. So, in the checkBST method, I'll keep track of the node count.

Let me modify the code:

private boolean checkBST(Node node, Set<Integer> seenValues, int nodeCount) {
    if (node == null) {
        return nodeCount == size;
    }

    if (seenValues.contains(node.value)) {
        return false;
    }

    seenValues.add(node.value);
    nodeCount++;

    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.value >= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.value <= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return nodeCount == size;
}

Wait, but the nodeCount is passed by value, not by reference. So, in the recursive calls, the nodeCount will be incremented correctly.

Yes, because each recursive call increases the nodeCount by 1.

So, the initial call would be checkBST(root, seenValues, 0).

But wait, in the initial call, if the root is null, the nodeCount should be 0, which should equal the size (which is 0). So, that's correct.

Let me adjust the code:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Set<Integer> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    return checkBST(root, seenValues, 0);
}

private boolean checkBST(Node node, Set<Integer> seenValues, int nodeCount) {
    if (node == null) {
        return nodeCount == size;
    }

    if (seenValues.contains(node.value)) {
        return false;
    }

    seenValues.add(node.value);
    nodeCount++;

    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.value >= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.value <= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return nodeCount == size;
}

This way, the method ensures that the tree has the correct number of nodes, the BST property is maintained, and there are no duplicates.

I think this covers all the necessary invariants for the BinTree class.
</think>

To ensure the BinTree class adheres to its invariants, the `repOK` method verifies the following:

1. **Negative Size Check**: The size must not be negative.
2. **Zero Size Check**: If the size is zero, the root must be null.
3. **Non-Null Root Check**: If the size is greater than zero, the root must not be null.
4. **BST Property**: Each node's left descendants must be less than the node, and right descendants must be greater.
5. **Unique Values**: No duplicate values exist in the tree.
6. **Size Consistency**: The number of nodes in the tree matches the size attribute.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Set<Integer> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    return checkBST(root, seenValues, 0);
}

private boolean checkBST(Node node, Set<Integer> seenValues, int nodeCount) {
    if (node == null) {
        return nodeCount == size;
    }

    if (seenValues.contains(node.value)) {
        return false;
    }

    seenValues.add(node.value);
    nodeCount++;

    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.value >= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.value <= node.value) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right, seenValues, nodeCount)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return nodeCount == size;
}
```

This method ensures that the BinTree maintains its BST structure, has no duplicate values, and accurately reflects its size.
