Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariants for the BinTree class. Let's start by understanding what a representation invariant is. It's a boolean method that checks if the object's state is valid. So, for each method in BinTree, I should think about what conditions must hold true for the object to be considered valid.

First, looking at the BinTree class, it has a root Node and a size variable. The add method adds nodes recursively, and there's a Node class with left and right children and info.

So, what could go wrong? Well, the size variable is supposed to represent the number of nodes in the tree. But if someone manually modifies the size without adding nodes, it could be inconsistent. So, a property could check that the size matches the actual number of nodes.

Next, each Node should have its left and right children as either null or pointing to another Node. So, a property could ensure that left and right are always valid Nodes or null.

Also, the root Node should never be null if the size is greater than zero. So, if size is positive, root must not be null.

Another thing is that in a binary tree, each node's left child should have a value less than the parent, and the right child should have a value greater than the parent. So, a property could check that the tree is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Lastly, the size should never be negative. That's a basic check but important to include.

Wait, but the user asked for only five properties. Let me list them:

1. Check that size is non-negative.
2. Ensure root is not null if size > 0.
3. Verify that each Node's left and right are valid.
4. Confirm that the tree maintains BST properties.
5. Ensure size matches the actual node count.

I think these cover the main points without being too redundant. I should make sure each is a valid condition that the class must maintain.
</think>

- Property Name: sizeIsNonNegative: The size of the tree must be non-negative.
- Property Name: rootNotNullIfSizePositive: The root must not be null if the size is greater than zero.
- Property Name: nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull: Each node's left and right children must be either null or a valid Node instance.
- Property Name: treeMaintainsBSTProperty: The tree must maintain the binary search tree property, where for every node, all left descendants have values less than the node's value, and all right descendants have values greater than the node's value.
- Property Name: sizeMatchesNodeCount: The size of the tree must match the actual number of nodes in the tree.

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the BinTree class that checks if the size is non-negative. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method should be a boolean method. So it will return true if the size is >=0, else false.

Looking at the BinTree class, the size is an instance variable initialized to 0. The add method increments size when a node is added. So the size should never be negative because it starts at 0 and only increases.

The method should access the size variable. Since size is private, the method can directly access it.

So the method will be something like:

public boolean sizeIsNonNegative() {
    return size >= 0;
}

Wait, but in Java, the method name should follow camelCase. The property name given is sizeIsNonNegative, which is correct.

I should make sure that the method is public and doesn't modify any state, just reads it.

Yes, that should do it. The method simply returns whether the size is non-negative, which aligns with the representation invariant.
</think>

public boolean sizeIsNonNegative() {
    return size >= 0;
}

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `BinTree` class that checks if the root is not null when the size is greater than zero. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the method should be a boolean method. So it will return true or false. The method should check two conditions: if the size is greater than zero, then the root must not be null. Otherwise, if the size is zero, the root can be null.

So the logic is: if size > 0, then root != null. If size is 0, root can be null. So the method should return true only when either size is zero and root is null, or size is positive and root is not null.

Wait, no. The property is that root must not be null if size is positive. So the condition is: if size > 0, then root != null. So the method should return true if (size == 0 and root == null) OR (size > 0 and root != null). Otherwise, it returns false.

So the method can be written as:

return (size == 0 && root == null) || (size > 0 && root != null);

Alternatively, it can be simplified. Since if size is positive, root must not be null. So another way is to check if size > 0 implies root != null. So the method can return (size == 0) || (root != null). But wait, that's not correct because when size is positive, root must not be null, but when size is zero, root can be null. So the correct condition is that when size is positive, root is not null. So the method should return true if (size == 0 && root == null) || (size > 0 && root != null).

So putting it all together, the method will be:

public boolean property() {
    return (size == 0 && root == null) || (size > 0 && root != null);
}

I think that's the correct implementation. It covers both cases: when size is zero, root must be null, and when size is positive, root must not be null.
</think>

public boolean property() {
    return (size == 0 && root == null) || (size > 0 && root != null);
}

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `BinTree` class that checks if each node's left and right children are either null or valid Node instances. 

First, I'll think about the structure of the `BinTree` class. It has a `root` Node and a `size`. The `add` method inserts nodes recursively. 

The property to enforce is that every node's left and right pointers must point to either another Node or be null. So, the method should traverse all nodes and check their children.

I'll start by writing a method `nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull()` that returns a boolean. 

Inside this method, I'll check if the root is null. If it is, then there are no nodes to check, so return true.

If the root isn't null, I'll need to traverse each node. I can do this recursively. For each node, I'll check if the left and right children are either null or instances of Node. Wait, but in Java, if they are not null, they should already be Nodes because the class structure defines left and right as Node types. So maybe the check is more about ensuring they are either null or valid, but perhaps the main issue is that they shouldn't be something else. However, in this case, since left and right are private and only set within the class, perhaps the main check is just ensuring they are either null or valid.

Wait, but the property is that each node's children are either null or a valid Node. So, perhaps the method should traverse each node and check that left and right are either null or valid. But since the left and right are of type Node, if they are not null, they are already Nodes. So maybe the check is just ensuring that they are not null when they should be, but perhaps the main point is to ensure that the structure is consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is more about ensuring that the tree is correctly formed, so that every node's children are either null or valid. So, the method should traverse each node and check that their left and right children are either null or valid.

So, the approach is:

1. If the root is null, return true.
2. Otherwise, traverse each node.
3. For each node, check that left is either null or a Node, and same for right.
4. Since left and right are Node references, if they are not null, they are valid Nodes. So perhaps the check is just ensuring that they are either null or not null, but that might not add any value. Alternatively, perhaps the check is more about ensuring that the tree is consistent, like no cycles or invalid references.

Wait, but in Java, if left is not null, it's a Node because the type is Node. So perhaps the check is more about ensuring that the tree doesn't have any inconsistencies, like a node pointing to a non-Node object, which isn't possible here because of the private access. So maybe the real check is just ensuring that the tree is correctly formed, perhaps checking for nulls where expected.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to ensure that all nodes are properly connected, so that every node's left and right children are either null or valid. So, the method should traverse each node and check that their left and right children are either null or valid.

So, the method will:

- Check if root is null: return true.
- Else, for each node, check left and right.
- If any node's left or right is not null and is not a Node, return false. But since left and right are Node types, this can't happen unless someone modifies them externally, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but perhaps the real issue is ensuring that the tree doesn't have any cycles or invalid references. So, the method should traverse each node and ensure that left and right are either null or valid Nodes, and also that the traversal doesn't cause infinite loops (like if a node's left points back up the tree, creating a cycle). But that's more about the data structure's integrity.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is simply that for every node, left and right are either null or a Node. So, the method can be written as:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node.left != null && !(node.left instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && !(node.right instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.left != null) {
        return checkChildren(node.left);
    }
    if (node.right != null) {
        return checkChildren(node.right);
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but node.left is of type Node, so node.left instanceof Node will always be true if it's not null. So this check is redundant. Therefore, perhaps the method is just ensuring that all nodes are reachable and that their children are either null or valid.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, so that every node's left and right children are either null or valid. So, the method can be written to traverse each node and check that their left and right are either null or valid.

But since left and right are Node references, the only thing to check is whether they are null or not. So, perhaps the method is just ensuring that the tree doesn't have any nodes with invalid children, which in this case, since the code only allows adding Nodes, it's always true. So, perhaps the property is always true, but the method is written to enforce that.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, so that every node's left and right are either null or valid. So, the method can be written as:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.left != null && !(node.left instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && !(node.right instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkChildren(node.left) && checkChildren(node.right);
}

But again, since node.left is a Node, the instanceof check is redundant. So perhaps the method is just to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, which it always is, so the method can return true.

Wait, but the property is that each node's left and right children are either null or a valid Node. So, perhaps the method is to check that for every node, left and right are either null or a Node. Since in the class, left and right are private and only set within the class, perhaps the method is just to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, which it always is, so the method can return true.

But that doesn't make sense because the method is supposed to be a representation invariant, which is a condition that must hold for the object to be valid. So, perhaps the method is to check that the tree is correctly formed, and if any node's left or right is null, it's allowed, but if they are not null, they must be Nodes.

But in the code, the left and right are always set to Node instances when they are not null. So, perhaps the method can simply return true because the invariant is always satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is to check that the tree is correctly formed, so that no node has a left or right child that is not a Node. But since the code ensures that, perhaps the method can return true.

But the user wants the method to return true if the object satisfies the property, false otherwise. So, perhaps the method is to check that all nodes' left and right are either null or valid Nodes.

So, the method can be written as:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.left != null && !(node.left instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && !(node.right instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkChildren(node.left) && checkChildren(node.right);
}

But again, since node.left is a Node, the instanceof check is redundant. So, perhaps the method can be simplified to:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.left != null && node.left.getClass() != Node.class) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && node.right.getClass() != Node.class) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkChildren(node.left) && checkChildren(node.right);
}

But this is still redundant because node.left is a Node. So, perhaps the method is just to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, which it always is, so the method can return true.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is to check that the tree is not null and that all nodes are properly connected. But that's more about the tree being non-null, which is not the case.

Wait, perhaps the property is that every node's left and right children are either null or a valid Node. So, the method should return true if all nodes satisfy this, else false.

So, the method can be written as:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.left != null && !(node.left instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && !(node.right instanceof Node)) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkChildren(node.left) && checkChildren(node.right);
}

But again, since node.left is a Node, the check is redundant. So, perhaps the method can be written as:

public boolean nodeChildrenAreNodesOrNull() {
    return checkChildren(root);
}

private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.left != null && node.left.getClass() != Node.class) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && node.right.getClass() != Node.class) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkChildren(node.left) && checkChildren(node.right);
}

But this is still redundant. So, perhaps the method is just to ensure that the tree is correctly formed, which it always is, so the method can return true.

Alternatively, perhaps the method is to check that the tree is not corrupted, so that no node has a left or right child that is not a Node. But since the code ensures that, perhaps the method can return true.

But the user wants the method to return true if the object satisfies the property, false otherwise. So, perhaps the method is to check that all nodes' left and right are either null or valid Nodes.

So, the method can be written as:

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `BinTree` class that checks if the tree maintains the binary search tree (BST) property. The BST property requires that for every node, all left descendants have values less than the node's value, and all right descendants have values greater than the node's value.

First, I'll think about how to traverse the tree to check this condition. A common approach is to perform an in-order traversal, which visits the left subtree, the node, and then the right subtree. During this traversal, I can keep track of the minimum and maximum values that each node can have.

Wait, but for a BST, each node has a specific range it must satisfy. The root can have any value, but as we go left, the maximum allowed value decreases, and as we go right, the minimum allowed value increases. So, for each node, its value must be greater than the minimum and less than the maximum allowed for its position.

So, the method should start at the root with min as negative infinity and max as positive infinity. For each node, check if its value is between min and max. Then, recursively check the left child with the new max being the current node's value, and the right child with the new min being the current node's value.

But wait, in the given `BinTree` class, the nodes are part of a tree, and the root is a single node. So, the `property` method will need to access the root and then perform this check.

I'll write a helper method that takes a node, a min, and a max. If the node is null, there's nothing to check, so return true. Otherwise, check if the node's info is greater than min and less than max. If not, return false. Then recursively check the left and right children with updated min and max values.

In the `property` method, I'll call this helper starting with the root, min as -infinity, and max as +infinity. If the helper returns true, then the tree maintains the BST property.

Wait, but in Java, how do I represent negative and positive infinity for integers? Oh right, I can use `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, but wait, no. Because for the initial root, the min should be the smallest possible integer, which is negative infinity, so I can use `Integer.MIN_VALUE` as a lower bound, but actually, it's better to use `Long.MIN_VALUE` or perhaps just use a long type for min and max to avoid integer overflow, but since the info is an int, maybe it's okay.

Wait, no. The `info` is an int, so using `Integer.MIN_VALUE` as the initial min and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the initial max makes sense. Because any int value will be greater than `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and less than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

So, the helper method could be something like:

private boolean checkBST(Node node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.info <= min || node.info >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.info) && checkBST(node.right, node.info, max);
}

Wait, no. Because in a BST, the left subtree must have values less than the node's value, and the right subtree must have values greater than the node's value. So, for the left child, the max is the node's value, and for the right child, the min is the node's value.

So, the condition should be: node.info > min && node.info < max.

Wait, but in the initial call, min is -infinity, which in Java is `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, but actually, for the root, the min should be the smallest possible integer, so perhaps using `Long.MIN_VALUE` as a lower bound, but since `info` is an int, maybe it's better to use `Integer.MIN_VALUE` as the initial min and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as the initial max.

Wait, no. Because `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest int, so any node's value must be greater than that. But for the left subtree, the max is the node's value, which could be as low as `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, but that's okay.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should be:

private boolean isBST(Node node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.info <= min || node.info >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBST(node.left, min, node.info) && isBST(node.right, node.info, max);
}

Wait, but in this case, the initial call would be `isBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)`.

But wait, in the BST property, each node's value must be greater than all values in the left subtree and less than all values in the right subtree. So, the helper function correctly enforces this by passing the node's value as the new max for the left and the new min for the right.

So, putting it all together, the `property` method would call this helper function starting with the root, min as `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, and max as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

But wait, in Java, `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest int, which is -2^31, and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` is 2^31 -1. So, any int value will be greater than `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and less than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

So, the `property` method would look like:

public boolean property() {
    return isBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}

And the helper method is as above.

Wait, but in the `BinTree` class, the `root` is a private variable, so the `property` method can access it directly.

So, the complete code would be:

public class BinTree {
    // ... existing code ...

    private boolean isBST(Node node, int min, int max) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (node.info <= min || node.info >= max) {
            return false;
        }
        return isBST(node.left, min, node.info) && isBST(node.right, node.info, max);
    }

    public boolean property() {
        return isBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    // ... rest of the code ...
}

Wait, but in the helper function, the condition is `node.info <= min || node.info >= max`, which returns false if the node's value is not strictly greater than min and strictly less than max. That's correct because in a BST, each node must be greater than all left descendants and less than all right descendants.

Wait, no. Because the helper function is checking that the node's value is greater than min and less than max. So, for the root, min is `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and max is `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. So, the root's value must be between those two. Then, for the left child, the max becomes the root's value, so the left child must be less than the root's value. For the right child, the min becomes the root's value, so the right child must be greater than the root's value.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the `property` method is implemented as a helper function that recursively checks each node against the allowed min and max values.

I think that's the correct approach.

```java
private boolean isBST(Node node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.info <= min || node.info >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBST(node.left, min, node.info) && isBST(node.right, node.info, max);
}

public boolean property() {
    return isBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}
```

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `sizeMatchesNodeCount` for the `BinTree` class. This method should return true if the size of the tree (as stored in the `size` variable) matches the actual number of nodes in the tree. 

First, I should think about how to calculate the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is a binary tree, so each node can have up to two children. The root is the starting point. If the root is null, the tree is empty, and the node count is zero.

I remember that to count the nodes in a binary tree, a common approach is to perform a traversal, like a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS). For this case, a recursive approach might be straightforward.

So, I'll create a helper method, maybe called `countNodes`, which takes a node as an argument and returns the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at that node. The base case is when the node is null, in which case the count is zero. Otherwise, the count is 1 (for the current node) plus the count of the left subtree plus the count of the right subtree.

Once I have this helper method, I can call it starting from the root of the tree. The result should be compared to the `size` variable. If they are equal, the method returns true; otherwise, false.

Wait, but what about the initial state when the tree is empty? If root is null, then `size` should be zero, and the node count is also zero, so it should return true.

I should also consider edge cases, like a tree with just the root node, or a tree where one side is longer than the other. The helper method should correctly count all nodes regardless of the tree's structure.

Putting it all together, the `sizeMatchesNodeCount` method will call `countNodes(root)` and compare it to `size`. If they match, return true; else, false.

I need to make sure that the helper method is private since it's only used within the class. Also, the method should be static if it's called from a static context, but in this case, it's called from an instance method, so it doesn't need to be static.

Wait, no, the `size` is an instance variable, so the helper method can be a private instance method. Alternatively, it can be a static method if the tree is static, but in this case, the tree is an instance variable, so the helper should be an instance method.

Wait, no, the helper method is just a function to count nodes given a root node. It doesn't need to be tied to an instance, so making it static might be better. Or perhaps not, since it's called from an instance method.

Alternatively, the helper can be a private method in the BinTree class. So, in the `sizeMatchesNodeCount` method, I'll call `countNodes(root)`.

So, the steps are:

1. Implement `countNodes(Node node)` which returns the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at `node`.
2. In `sizeMatchesNodeCount`, call `countNodes(root)` and compare to `size`.

Now, writing the code:

The helper method:

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

Then, the property method:

public boolean sizeMatchesNodeCount() {
    int actualNodes = countNodes(root);
    return actualNodes == size;
}

Wait, but in Java, the method should be a boolean method without parameters, as per the user's instruction. So the method signature is correct.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
</think>

```java
private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

public boolean sizeMatchesNodeCount() {
    return countNodes(root) == size;
}
```
