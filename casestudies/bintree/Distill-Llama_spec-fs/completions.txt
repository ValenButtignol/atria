Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the BinTree class. Let me look at the code provided to understand what it does.

First, the BinTree class has a root node and a size counter. The add method takes an integer x and adds it to the tree. If the root is null, it creates a new node with x as the info and increments the size. Otherwise, it calls addRecursive on the root with x.

The addRecursive method is a helper that takes the current node and the value x. It checks if x is equal to the current node's info. If so, it does nothing because the tree is supposed to have unique values. If x is less than the current node's info, it tries to add it to the left subtree. If the left child is null, it creates a new node and increments the size. Otherwise, it recursively calls addRecursive on the left child. If x is greater than the current node's info, it does the same for the right subtree.

The getSize method simply returns the size, which is the number of nodes in the tree.

The Node class is a static inner class with left and right children and an info field. It's initialized with the given info.

So, the behavior of BinTree is that it's a binary search tree (BST) where each node holds an integer, and each node can have a left and right child. The add method ensures that each new node is placed in the correct position according to BST rules, and the size is updated accordingly.

Key attributes are root, which is the starting point of the tree, and size, which tracks the number of nodes. The nodes themselves have info, left, and right attributes.

Constraints include that the tree must maintain the BST property, meaning for every node, all left descendants are less than it, and all right descendants are greater than it. Also, the size must always be a non-negative integer and consistent with the structure of the tree.

So, the informal specification should capture these aspects: the tree's structure, how nodes are added, the size tracking, and the BST property.
</think>

**Informal Specification for the BinTree Class**

**Behavior:**
- The BinTree class represents a binary search tree (BST) that stores unique integer values.
- The tree is structured such that for every node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater than the node.
- The add method inserts a new integer into the tree, ensuring no duplicates, by recursively placing it in the left or right subtree as appropriate.
- The size method returns the total number of nodes in the tree.

**Attributes:**
- root (Node): Reference to the first node in the BST. Initially null.
- size (int): Tracks the number of nodes in the tree. Starts at 0 and increments with each successful add operation.

**Properties:**
- **BST Property:** The tree maintains the BST property where each node's value is greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree.
- **Unique Values:** The tree ensures that each value is unique.
- **Size Consistency:** The size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Non-negative Size:** The size attribute is always a non-negative integer.

**Constraints:**
- The tree must always maintain the BST structure.
- The size must not be negative and must be consistent with the tree's structure.
- Duplicate values cannot be inserted into the tree.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Hmm, what's a representation invariant? From what I remember, it's a method that checks if the current state of the object is consistent with its specification. So, for the BinTree, I need to make sure that it behaves like a BST, with all the properties it's supposed to have.

Let me look at the BinTree class. It has a root node, and a size. The add method adds nodes recursively, ensuring that the tree remains a BST. So, the invariant should check if the tree is indeed a BST and that the size is correct.

First, I should think about the BST property. For each node, all nodes in the left subtree should be less than the current node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree should be greater. So, I need a way to check this recursively.

Wait, the class uses a private Node class with left, right, and info attributes. So, I'll need to traverse the tree and verify the BST property.

Also, the size should be equal to the number of nodes in the tree. So, I need to count the nodes and ensure it matches the size variable.

Another thing is that the size shouldn't be negative. So, I should check if size is less than zero.

How do I traverse the tree? I can start from the root and go through each node, checking left and right children.

Let me outline the steps for the repOK method:

1. Check if the size is negative. If yes, return false.
2. If the size is zero, check if the root is null. If not, return false.
3. If the root is null, ensure size is zero. If not, return false.
4. Traverse the tree starting from the root.
5. For each node, check that all left descendants are less than the node's value.
6. Check that all right descendants are greater than the node's value.
7. Count the number of nodes to ensure it matches the size.

Wait, but how do I count the nodes? I can have a counter that increments as I visit each node. Then, compare it with the size.

Also, I should make sure that the tree is acyclic. But since it's a BST, the structure inherently prevents cycles because each node points to either left or right, and there's no way to loop back.

Do I need to check for cycles? Maybe not, because the add method ensures that each node is added in a way that doesn't create cycles.

So, focusing on the BST property and size consistency.

Let me think about how to implement this in Java. The repOK method should return a boolean.

I can write a helper method to check the BST property and count the nodes.

Wait, but for the repOK method, I can do it all in one method.

So, the steps in code:

- Check if size < 0 → return false.
- If size == 0 → check if root is null. If not, return false.
- If root is null → check if size is 0. If not, return false.
- Else, traverse the tree, checking each node's value against its children.

How to traverse? Maybe recursively.

I can write a helper method that takes a node and checks its left and right children.

Wait, but in the repOK method, I can do it iteratively or recursively. Maybe recursively is cleaner.

So, in the repOK method:

- Check size conditions.
- If the tree is empty, ensure root is null and size is 0.
- Else, start from root and check each node.

Let me sketch some code.

First, check size:

if (size < 0) return false;

if (size == 0) {
    return (root == null);
}

if (root == null) {
    return (size == 0);
}

Then, traverse the tree.

I can use a queue or stack to traverse each node.

Alternatively, use a recursive approach.

Let me try recursive:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return (root == null);
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return (size == 0);
    }

    return checkBST(root) && (countNodes(root) == size);
}

Then, write checkBST and countNodes.

Wait, but in Java, I can't have helper methods in the same class if they are static. Or, I can make them static.

Alternatively, I can do everything in one method.

Alternatively, I can write it all in one method without helper functions.

Let me try to write it all in repOK.

So, after the initial checks, I can traverse each node.

I can use a Set to keep track of visited nodes to prevent infinite loops, but in a BST, there shouldn't be cycles, so maybe it's not necessary. But to be safe, perhaps include it.

Wait, but in a BST, each node's left and right children are either null or point to descendants, so there's no way to have cycles. So, no need for a visited set.

So, I can traverse each node, checking the BST property.

Let me write code that for each node, checks that all left descendants are less and all right are greater.

So, for each node, check left child: if exists, its value < current node's value.

Similarly, right child: if exists, its value > current node's value.

So, in code:

for (Node current = root; current != null; current = current.left) {
    // Check left child
    if (current.left != null) {
        if (current.left.info >= current.info) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check right child
    if (current.right != null) {
        if (current.right.info <= current.info) {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

Wait, but this only checks the immediate children. What about deeper descendants?

No, because if the left child is greater than the current node, then the subtree under it is invalid. So, I need to check recursively.

So, perhaps a helper method that checks each node's children.

Alternatively, write a recursive method that for each node, checks its left and right children.

Let me try writing a helper method:

private boolean checkBST(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

Then, in repOK:

return checkBST(root) && (countNodes(root) == size);

Now, how to count the nodes.

I can write another helper method:

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

So, putting it all together.

But wait, in the BinTree class, the Node class is private and static. So, the helper methods can be static.

Alternatively, make them instance methods.

Wait, but in the given code, the add method is non-static, so the helper methods can be static.

So, in the BinTree class, I can have static helper methods.

So, the repOK method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return (root == null);
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return (size == 0);
    }
    return checkBST(root) && (countNodes(root) == size);
}

private static boolean checkBST(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.left)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!checkBST(node.right)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

private static int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the given code, the Node class is inside BinTree, so these helper methods can access it.

Alternatively, I can make them instance methods, but static is better since they don't depend on instance variables.

But in Java, static methods can't be called from instances unless they are made public.

Wait, no, in this case, since repOK is an instance method, and the helper methods are static, they can be called as BinTree.checkBST(root).

So, that should be fine.

Alternatively, I can make the helper methods instance methods, but then they would have to be called as this.checkBST(root), which is also acceptable.

But since they don't rely on instance variables, static is better.

So, the final code would have the repOK method as above, with the two helper methods.

I think this should cover all the properties: BST structure and size consistency.

Let me double-check.

- Size is non-negative: checked at the beginning.
- If size is zero, root must be null: checked.
- If root is not null, size must be at least 1: checked.
- BST property: checked via checkBST.
- Size matches the number of nodes: checked via countNodes.

Yes, this should work.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class, which represents a binary search tree (BST). The invariant should ensure that the tree adheres to the BST properties and that the size of the tree is consistent with the number of nodes.

### Approach
The representation invariant for the BinTree class involves two main checks:
1. **BST Property Check**: Ensure that each node's value is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.
2. **Size Consistency Check**: Ensure that the size of the tree, as tracked by the `size` variable, matches the actual number of nodes in the tree.

The approach involves:
1. **Initial Checks**: Verify that the size is non-negative and that the tree structure is consistent with its size.
2. **Recursive BST Check**: Traverse the tree recursively to ensure each node's value respects the BST property.
3. **Node Count Check**: Count the number of nodes in the tree and compare it with the tracked size.

### Solution Code
```java
public class BinTree {
    private static class Node {
        private Node left; 
        private Node right;
        private int info;

        public Node(int info) {
            this.info = info;
        }
    }

    private Node root;
    private int size = 0;

    public void add(int x) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new Node(x);
            size++;
        } else {
            addRecursive(root, x);
        }
    }

    private void addRecursive(Node current, int x) {
        if (x == current.info) {
            return;
        } else if (x < current.info) {
            if (current.left == null) {
                current.left = new Node(x);
                size++;
            } else {
                addRecursive(current.left, x);
            }
        } else {
            if (current.right == null) {
                current.right = new Node(x);
                size++;
            } else {
                addRecursive(current.right, x);
            }
        }
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public static boolean repOK() {
        if (BinTree.size < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (BinTree.size == 0) {
            return (BinTree.root == null);
        }
        if (BinTree.root == null) {
            return (BinTree.size == 0);
        }

        return checkBST(BinTree.root) && (countNodes(BinTree.root) == BinTree.size);
    }

    private static boolean checkBST(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        // Check left child
        if (node.left != null) {
            if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkBST(node.left)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // Check right child
        if (node.right != null) {
            if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkBST(node.right)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private static int countNodes(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Checks**: The method first checks if the size is negative, which is invalid. If the size is zero, it ensures the root is null. If the root is null but the size is not zero, it returns false.
2. **BST Property Check**: The `checkBST` method recursively checks each node to ensure that all left descendants are less than the current node and all right descendants are greater than the current node.
3. **Node Count Check**: The `countNodes` method recursively counts the number of nodes in the tree. It compares this count with the tracked size to ensure consistency.

This approach ensures that the BinTree class maintains the BST structure and that the size is accurately tracked, thus upholding the representation invariant.
