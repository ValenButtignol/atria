Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. The repOK method should check if the object's state is valid. Let me think about what properties the BinTree must satisfy.

First, the size variable is supposed to represent the number of nodes in the tree. So, I should check that size is non-negative. If it's negative, that's invalid.

Next, the root node's structure must be correct. Each node has left and right children, which should either be null or point to another Node. I need to ensure that the tree doesn't have any cycles, which would cause infinite loops when traversing. So, I'll have to track visited nodes.

I should also verify that the size matches the actual number of nodes. One way to do this is to traverse the tree and count the nodes, then compare that count to the size variable.

Let me outline the steps:
1. Check if size is negative. If yes, return false.
2. If size is zero, ensure the root is null.
3. If size is positive, traverse the tree to count nodes and check for cycles.
4. Compare the counted nodes with the size.

I'll use a helper method to traverse the tree, keeping track of visited nodes to detect cycles. Also, I'll count each node visited and ensure the count equals the size.

Wait, but how do I handle the traversal? I can perform a depth-first search, marking each node as visited and incrementing the count. If I encounter a node that's already visited, that's a cycle, so return false.

So, in the repOK method, I'll first check the size. Then, if size is positive, I'll traverse the tree, count nodes, and check for cycles. Finally, I'll compare the count with size.

I should also make sure that the traversal doesn't miss any nodes and correctly counts each one.

Another thing: the root should not be null if size is positive. So, if size > 0 and root is null, that's invalid.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will:

- Return false if size is negative.
- If size is zero, check that root is null.
- If size is positive, check root is not null, then traverse, count nodes, and check for cycles. If the count doesn't match size, return false.
- Otherwise, return true.

I think that covers all the necessary checks to ensure the BinTree is in a valid state.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
    int nodeCount = 0;
    Node current = root;
    
    while (current != null) {
        if (!visited.add(current)) {
            return false; // Cycle detected
        }
        nodeCount++;
        // Traverse all children
        if (current.left != null) {
            Node left = current.left;
            while (left != null) {
                if (!visited.add(left)) {
                    return false;
                }
                nodeCount++;
                left = left.left;
            }
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            Node right = current.right;
            while (right != null) {
                if (!visited.add(right)) {
                    return false;
                }
                nodeCount++;
                right = right.right;
            }
        }
        current = current.right; // Move to right child after processing left subtree
    }
    
    return nodeCount == size;
}
```
