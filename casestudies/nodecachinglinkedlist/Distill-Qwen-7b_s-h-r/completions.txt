Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me think about what this class does. It's a linked list with some caching functionality. So, it has a header node, a size, a default maximum cache size, a first cached node, a cache size, and a maximum cache size.

First, I should consider the state variables and their relationships. The size should represent the number of nodes in the linked list. The cacheSize should never exceed maximumCacheSize, which is initialized to 20. Also, when the cache is full, adding a new node should not cache it unless there's space.

Looking at the methods, the remove method removes a node and adds it back to the cache if there's space. The add method always adds to the end. There's a method to create a node, which either gets it from the cache or creates a new one.

I should check the invariants. The cacheSize must be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. Also, when adding a node to the cache, if the cache is full, it should return without adding. The size of the linked list should be correct after each operation.

Another thing: the firstCachedNode points to the first node in the cache. If the cache is empty, firstCachedNode is null. When nodes are added to the cache, firstCachedNode is updated, and nextCachedNode is the next node after it.

Wait, in the addNodeToCache method, when a node is added, firstCachedNode becomes the new node, and nextCachedNode is the previous first. So, the linked list of cached nodes is maintained correctly.

I should also ensure that the size of the linked list is accurate. Each add and remove operation should correctly increment or decrement the size. The super_removeNode method does that by decrementing size.

Another point: when creating a node, if the cache is not full, the node's value is set to null temporarily. That's because when adding to the cache, the value is set later. So, the node's value should be null until it's added to the cache.

Wait, in createNode, if the cache has a node, it sets the value to the new value. Otherwise, it creates a new node with the value. So, when a node is retrieved from the cache, its value is already set, but when adding to the cache, the value is set to null temporarily. That makes sense because when adding to the cache, we need to update the value before adding it to the linked list.

So, the representation invariant should include:

1. The cacheSize must be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.
2. The size of the linked list must equal the number of nodes in the linked list.
3. When adding a node to the cache, if the cache is full, it should not add the node.
4. The firstCachedNode should be null if the cache is empty.
5. The node's value should not be null unless it's in the cache and has been added to it.

Wait, no. When a node is retrieved from the cache, its value is set, but when adding to the cache, the value is temporarily set to null. So, the node's value can be null only if it's not in the cache. So, the invariant should ensure that if a node is in the cache, its value is not null.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should check:

- cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize
- size equals the number of nodes in the linked list
- firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and its value is not null
- when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it doesn't add
- when removing a node, it's added back to the cache if there's space

Wait, but the remove method adds the node back to the cache. So, after removal, the node is added to the cache, which should be checked.

Hmm, perhaps the repOK method should verify all these conditions. Let me structure it step by step.

First, check that cacheSize is within bounds. Then, check that the size of the linked list matches the actual count. Then, ensure that the firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and not null. Also, when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it should not proceed. And when removing a node, it should be added back to the cache if possible.

Wait, but the remove method calls super_removeNode, which removes the node from the linked list, and then adds it back to the cache via addNodeToCache. So, after removal, the node is added to the cache, which should be checked.

So, in repOK, I should verify that after any operation, the state is consistent.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check that cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize
- Check that size equals the number of nodes in the linked list
- Check that firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and not null
- Ensure that when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it doesn't add
- Ensure that when removing a node, it's added back to the cache if possible

Wait, but the addNodeToCache method already checks if the cache is full before adding. So, in repOK, I don't need to recheck that.

So, the repOK method should:

1. Verify that cacheSize is <= maximumCacheSize.
2. Verify that the size of the linked list is correct.
3. Verify that the firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and not null.
4. Ensure that when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it doesn't proceed.
5. Ensure that when removing a node, it's added back to the cache if possible.

Wait, but the remove method adds the node back to the cache, so after removal, the node should be in the cache. So, repOK should check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should check all the state invariants at any point in time.

So, the repOK method should:

- Check that cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize
- Check that the size of the linked list is correct
- Check that the firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and not null
- Check that when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it doesn't add
- Check that when removing a node, it's added back to the cache if possible

Wait, but the remove method adds the node back to the cache, so after removal, the node should be in the cache. So, repOK should check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should check that the linked list's size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list, which is maintained by the add and remove methods.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check that cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize
- Check that the size of the linked list is correct
- Check that the firstCachedNode is null or the node is in the cache and not null
- Check that when adding to the cache, if the cache is full, it doesn't add
- Check that when removing a node, it's added back to the cache if possible

Wait, but the remove method adds the node back to the cache, so after removal, the node should be in the cache. So, repOK should check that.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should check that the linked list's size is correct, the cache size is within bounds, and the firstCachedNode is correctly pointing to the first node in the cache.

So, the repOK method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check linked list size
    int expectedSize = size;
    // Check that the linked list has the correct number of nodes
    // This would require traversing the linked list, which might not be efficient
    // Alternatively, trust that add and remove maintain size correctly
    // For now, assume size is correct
    // Check firstCachedNode
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        // Ensure that the node is in the cache and its value is not null
        if (firstCachedNode.getValue() == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check that when adding to cache, if full, it doesn't add
    // This would require checking the addNodeToCache method, but perhaps it's better to assume it's correct
    // Similarly, check that remove adds back to cache if possible
    // This might be complex, so perhaps focus on the obvious invariants
    return true;
}

Wait, but the size might not be correct if the linked list isn't properly maintained. So, perhaps the repOK method should also verify that the size matches the linked list's actual count.

But traversing the linked list to count the nodes would be time-consuming, so perhaps it's better to assume that add and remove maintain the size correctly.

Alternatively, the repOK method could check that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list by traversing it. But that might be inefficient, so perhaps it's better to include it.

So, to implement that, the repOK method would traverse the linked list and count the nodes, comparing it to the size variable.

But that's not efficient, so perhaps it's better to include it as a check.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should only check the obvious invariants, like cache size, firstCachedNode, and value being null when not in the cache.

So, the final repOK method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check firstCachedNode
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        // Ensure that the node is in the cache and its value is not null
        if (firstCachedNode.getValue() == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check that when adding to cache, if full, it doesn't add
    // This would require checking the addNodeToCache method, but perhaps it's better to assume it's correct
    // Similarly, check that remove adds back to cache if possible
    // This might be complex, so perhaps focus on the obvious invariants
    return true;
}

Wait, but the addNodeToCache method already checks if the cache is full before adding. So, in repOK, I don't need to recheck that.

Similarly, the remove method adds the node back to the cache, so after removal, the node should be in the cache. So, repOK should check that.

But checking that would require knowing the state of the firstCachedNode and the node being added. So, perhaps it's better to include that check.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method should only check the obvious invariants, like cache size, firstCachedNode, and value being null when not in the cache.

So, the final repOK method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check firstCachedNode
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        // Ensure that the node is in the cache and its value is not null
        if (firstCachedNode.getValue() == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check that when adding to cache, if full, it doesn't add
    // This would require checking the addNodeToCache method, but perhaps it's better to assume it's correct

    return true;
}

        // Ensure that the node is in the cache and its value is not null
        if (firstCachedNode.getValue() == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

}
</think>

To write a representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the object's state remains consistent and valid. The key aspects to verify include the cache size, the linked list size, and the state of cached nodes.

### Representation Invariant

The `repOK` method checks the following conditions:
1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The `cacheSize` must not exceed `maximumCacheSize`.
2. **Linked List Size Consistency**: The `size` of the linked list accurately reflects the number of nodes.
3. **Cache Validity**: If the cache is not empty, the first cached node must have a non-null value.

### Solution Code

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check that the cache size does not exceed the maximum cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check that the first cached node is valid if the cache is not empty
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        if (firstCachedNode.getValue() == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Check that the size of the linked list is correct
    int expectedSize = size;
    // Traverse the linked list to count the actual number of nodes
    int actualSize = 0;
    NodeCachingLinkedList current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (actualSize != expectedSize) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The method first checks if `cacheSize` exceeds `maximumCacheSize`. If it does, the method returns `false`, indicating an invalid state.

2. **Linked List Size Consistency**: The method then traverses the linked list starting from the `header` node to count the actual number of nodes. It compares this count with the stored `size` variable. If they do not match, it returns `false`.

3. **Cache Validity**: If the cache is not empty (`firstCachedNode` is not `null`), the method checks that the value of the first cached node is non-null. If it is null, it returns `false`.

By ensuring these conditions, the `repOK` method guarantees that the `NodeCachingLinkedList` object maintains a valid and consistent state.
