Alright, so I'm trying to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. I'm not entirely sure what a representation invariant is, but I think it's something that ensures the internal state of the object remains consistent and behaves as expected. 

Looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class, it seems to be a linked list with some caching functionality. It has methods like add, remove, and some helper methods for managing the cache. There's also a private node called header, and some variables like size, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize.

First, I need to understand what the class is supposed to do. From the code, it looks like when you add a new node, it either adds it to the cache or creates a new node from the cache. If the cache is full, adding a new node might not be possible, or it might evict an existing node from the cache. The remove method seems to remove a node from the linked list and then add it back to the cache if there's space.

So, the representation invariant should ensure that the state of the linked list and the cache behaves correctly. I need to think about what properties must always hold true.

One thing that comes to mind is that the cache should never have more nodes than the maximumCacheSize. So, the cacheSize variable should always be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. That makes sense because if it's equal, the cache is full, and adding more nodes should evict some.

Another thing is that the header node's next pointer should point to the first node in the linked list. If the linked list is empty, the header's next should be null. That ensures that the linked list is correctly structured.

Also, the size of the linked list (the number of nodes) should be equal to the size of the cache because each node in the cache is part of the linked list. So, size and cacheSize should always be the same.

I should also consider that when adding a node, if it's added to the cache, the cacheSize increases, and the size of the linked list increases. If it's not added to the cache, the size of the linked list increases, but the cacheSize remains the same.

Wait, but in the add method, it calls addLast, which adds a node to the end of the linked list. If the cache is not full, it adds the node to the cache. So, the cacheSize should always be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize, and the size of the linked list should always equal the cacheSize.

Also, when removing a node, it's removed from the linked list and then added back to the cache if there's space. So, after removal, the size of the linked list decreases, but the cacheSize might increase if the node was evicted from the cache.

Hmm, I'm not sure about that part. Let me think again. When you remove a node, you first remove it from the linked list, which decreases the size. Then, you add it back to the cache if there's space. So, if the cache had space, the cacheSize increases by one, and the size of the linked list increases by one again. If the cache was full, the cacheSize remains the same, but the size of the linked list decreases by one.

This suggests that the size of the linked list should always equal the cacheSize. So, whenever the size changes, the cacheSize should change accordingly.

Another thing to consider is that the header node's next should always point to the first node in the linked list, or null if the list is empty. This ensures that the linked list is correctly formed.

Also, the cache should only contain nodes that are part of the linked list. So, if the linked list has nodes, the cache should have some of them, but not more than the maximumCacheSize.

I'm also thinking about the case when the linked list is empty. In that case, the header's next should be null, and the cacheSize should be zero.

So, putting this all together, the representation invariant should include:

1. The cacheSize is always less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.
2. The size of the linked list equals the cacheSize.
3. The header's next points to the first node in the linked list, or null if the list is empty.
4. The cache contains only nodes that are part of the linked list.

I think these properties ensure that the internal state of the NodeCachingLinkedList is consistent and behaves as expected. If any of these properties are violated, it would indicate an inconsistency in the data structure's state.
</think>

To write a representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the internal state of the class remains consistent and behaves as expected. The invariant should capture the essential properties that must always hold true.

### Representation Invariant

The following conditions must always be satisfied:

1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The `cacheSize` must not exceed the `maximumCacheSize`.
2. **Consistency Between Sizes**: The size of the linked list (`size`) must always equal the size of the cache (`cacheSize`).
3. **Header Node Structure**: The `header.next` must point to the first node in the linked list, or `null` if the list is empty.
4. **Cache Contents Validity**: The cache contains only nodes that are part of the linked list.

### Java Code

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check 1: Cache size does not exceed maximumCacheSize
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check 2: Size of linked list equals cache size
    if (size != cacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check 3: Header's next points to the first node or null if empty
    LinkedListNode headerNode = header;
    if (headerNode.next != null) {
        if (headerNode.next != firstCachedNode) {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        if (firstCachedNode != null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check 4: Cache contains only nodes present in the linked list
    while (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode cachedNode = firstCachedNode;
        firstCachedNode = cachedNode.next;
        cachedNode.next = null; // Prevent cycles

        if (cachedNode.getValue() != null) {
            LinkedListNode linkedListNode = header.next;
            while (linkedListNode != null) {
                if (cachedNode.getValue() == linkedListNode.getValue()) {
                    return false; // Duplicate found in cache
                }
                linkedListNode = linkedListNode.next;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The first check ensures that the `cacheSize` does not exceed the `maximumCacheSize`. This prevents the cache from becoming full and unable to add new nodes.

2. **Consistency Between Sizes**: The second check verifies that the size of the linked list (`size`) is always equal to the size of the cache (`cacheSize`). This ensures that the cache accurately reflects the current state of the linked list.

3. **Header Node Structure**: The third check ensures that the `header.next` points to the first node in the linked list. If the list is empty, `header.next` should be `null`. This maintains the structural integrity of the linked list.

4. **Cache Contents Validity**: The fourth check iterates through each node in the cache and verifies that it does not contain duplicate values that are already present in the linked list. This ensures that the cache only contains valid and unique nodes from the linked list.

By enforcing these conditions, the `repOK` method ensures that the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class maintains a consistent and valid internal state.
