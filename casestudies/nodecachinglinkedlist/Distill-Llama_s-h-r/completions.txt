Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has several fields: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. The header is a LinkedListNode, and there are various methods for adding, removing, and caching nodes.

I remember that in a linked list, the header should always point to the first node, and the list should be properly linked. So, I should check if the header's next is the first node and that the first node's previous is the header. Also, the size should be consistent with the structure.

Next, considering the caching mechanism. The cache should not exceed the maximum cache size. So, I'll check if cacheSize is less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. Also, the firstCachedNode should point to a node that's part of the linked list, and the cache should not have more nodes than allowed.

I should also ensure that when nodes are added to the cache, they are correctly linked. The firstCachedNode's next should point to the next cached node, and the last cached node's next should be null. Similarly, when nodes are removed from the cache, the links should be updated properly.

Wait, but the repOK method should only check the invariant properties that are definitely correct. So, I need to make sure that all these conditions are met without any assumptions.

Let me outline the checks:

1. The header's next should be the first node, and the first node's previous should be the header.
2. The size should equal the number of nodes in the list, which can be checked by traversing from the header.
3. The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size.
4. The firstCachedNode should be a valid node in the list, and the cache should form a proper linked list among itself.

I think these are all necessary to ensure the object's invariants are maintained.

Now, how to implement this in Java. The repOK method will perform these checks and return false if any condition fails.

I'll start by checking the header's next and the first node's previous. Then, I'll traverse the list to ensure the size matches. For the cache, I'll check the cache size against maximumCacheSize and verify the links within the cache.

I should also handle cases where the firstCachedNode might be null, which is allowed initially, but if it's not null, it should form a valid cache list.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks step by step, returning false if any condition is violated.

To determine if the `NodeCachingLinkedList` object is in a valid state, the `repOK` method verifies several key properties:

1. **Header and First Node Links**: Ensures the header points to the first node and the first node correctly references the header.
2. **List Size Consistency**: Confirms the size matches the actual number of nodes in the list.
3. **Cache Size and Structure**: Checks that the cache size does not exceed the maximum allowed and that the cache nodes form a valid linked list.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header and first node links
    if (header.next != firstCachedNode || firstCachedNode.previous != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check list size consistency
    int size = this.size;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    int actualSize = 0;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (size != actualSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size and structure
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if cache is properly linked
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode nextCachedNode = firstCachedNode.next;
        if (nextCachedNode == null || nextCachedNode.previous != firstCachedNode) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check if the last cached node's next is null
        LinkedListNode lastCachedNode = nextCachedNode;
        while (lastCachedNode.next != null) {
            lastCachedNode = lastCachedNode.next;
        }
        if (lastCachedNode.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
