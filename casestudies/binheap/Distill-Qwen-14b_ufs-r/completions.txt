Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. Let me think about what the class represents and what invariants must hold.

First, the BinomialHeap is a data structure that implements a priority queue using binomial trees. Each node in the heap has a key, degree, parent, sibling, and child. The class has methods for inserting, deleting, extracting the minimum, and other operations.

The representation invariant should check that the data structure is in a valid state after any operation. So, what properties must hold?

1. **Heap Property**: Each node's key must be less than or equal to the keys of its children. This ensures that the minimum key is at the root of each binomial tree.

2. **Binomial Tree Property**: Each binomial tree of degree d has exactly d children. Moreover, for any two nodes in the same tree, their paths to the root must have the same length. This ensures that the trees are properly structured.

3. **Forest Property**: The entire heap is a collection of binomial trees where each tree's degree is unique. That is, for any two trees in the forest, their degrees are different. This allows the efficient merging of two heaps.

4. **Consistency of Size**: The size variable should correctly reflect the number of nodes in the heap. This can be checked by comparing the size with the sum of the sizes of all binomial trees.

5. **No Null Pointers in Structure**: Each node's parent, sibling, and child pointers should form a valid structure without cycles or invalid references.

Let me think about how to implement each of these checks.

For the heap property, I can traverse each node and ensure that its key is less than or equal to its children's keys. But since the heap is made up of multiple binomial trees, I need to check each tree individually.

The binomial tree property requires that each node's degree is equal to the number of its children. So, for each node, the degree should be equal to the number of children it has. Also, the structure should ensure that each level of the tree has exactly the same number of nodes, which might be more complex to check.

The forest property is that all binomial trees in the heap have distinct degrees. So, I can collect the degrees of all root nodes and ensure there are no duplicates.

For the size, I can calculate the total number of nodes by traversing all the trees and summing their sizes, then compare it to the size variable.

Regarding the structure, I should ensure that there are no cycles in the parent pointers. This can be done by traversing each node's parent chain and ensuring it eventually reaches null without revisiting any node.

Putting this together, the repOK method will perform several checks:

1. **Check Heap Property**: For each node, its key is <= its children's keys.
2. **Check Binomial Tree Property**: Each node's degree equals the number of children, and the tree structure is valid (each level has the same number of nodes).
3. **Check Forest Property**: All root nodes have unique degrees.
4. **Check Size Consistency**: The size variable matches the sum of nodes in all trees.
5. **Check for Cycles in Parent Pointers**: No cycles exist in the parent hierarchy.

Now, how to implement each check.

For the heap property, I can iterate through each node and compare it with its children. But since the heap is a forest, I need to process each root node and its subtree.

The binomial tree property can be checked by ensuring that for each node, its degree is equal to the number of children it has. Also, for each node, the number of descendants at each level should be consistent with the degree.

The forest property can be checked by collecting the degrees of all root nodes and ensuring they are all unique.

For size consistency, I can write a helper method that recursively calculates the number of nodes in each tree and sums them up, then compare it to the size variable.

For cycle checking, I can traverse each node's parent chain and keep track of visited nodes. If I encounter a node more than once, there's a cycle.

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. **Heap Property Check**:
   - For each node, check that its key is <= its children's keys.

2. **Binomial Tree Structure Check**:
   - For each node, its degree should equal the number of children.
   - For each node, the tree should be a proper binomial tree where each level has exactly the same number of nodes.

3. **Forest Property Check**:
   - Collect all root nodes' degrees and ensure they are unique.

4. **Size Check**:
   - Calculate the total number of nodes by traversing all trees and summing their sizes.

5. **Cycle Check**:
   - For each node, traverse its parent chain and ensure no cycles.

Now, considering the BinomialHeapNode class, each node has a 'child' and 'sibling' pointer. The 'sibling' pointers form a linked list of children for a node. So, the number of children is the number of siblings plus one (the first child).

Wait, no. The 'child' is the first child, and 'sibling' is the next sibling. So, the number of children is determined by traversing the sibling chain starting from 'child'. So, for a node, the number of children is the count of nodes reachable via 'child' and 'sibling' until null.

So, for a node, the number of children is the count of nodes in its child subtree. So, to check the binomial tree property, for each node, its degree should equal the number of children it has.

So, for each node, I can write a helper method to count the number of children by traversing the child and sibling pointers.

Another point: in a binomial tree, each level has exactly the same number of nodes. So, for a node of degree d, each level from 0 to d has exactly 2^d nodes. Wait, no, that's not correct. A binomial tree of degree d has exactly d children, and each level has exactly one node. Wait, no, that's not right. A binomial tree of degree d has d children, each of which is the root of a binomial tree of degree d-1, d-2, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, a binomial tree of order k (sometimes called degree k) has exactly k edges, so k+1 nodes. But in the context of the BinomialHeap, each node's degree is the number of children it has. So, for a node with degree d, it has d children, each of which is the root of a binomial tree of lower degree.

So, for the binomial tree property, each node's degree must equal the number of its children. So, for each node, I can count the number of children by traversing the child and sibling pointers, and check that it equals the degree.

So, the helper method for counting children would be:

private int countChildren(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    int count = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = node.child;
    while (current != null) {
        count++;
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return count;
}

Then, for each node, check that countChildren(node) == node.degree.

Next, the forest property: all root nodes must have unique degrees. So, collect all the degrees of the root nodes and ensure there are no duplicates.

To collect the root nodes, I can traverse the Nodes and their siblings until I reach the end. Each root node is a separate tree in the forest.

Wait, the BinomialHeap has a 'Nodes' field which is the root of the forest. But the forest is a collection of trees, each with their own root. So, the 'Nodes' is the first root, and the siblings of 'Nodes' are the other roots. So, to collect all root nodes, I can start with 'Nodes' and then follow the sibling pointers until null.

So, for each root node, get its degree and add it to a set. If the size of the set is less than the number of roots, then there are duplicate degrees, which violates the forest property.

Now, the size check: the size variable should equal the total number of nodes in all trees. So, I can write a helper method that recursively counts the nodes in each tree.

private int countNodes(BinomialHeapNode root) {
    if (root == null) return 0;
    return 1 + countNodes(root.child) + countNodes(root.sibling);
}

Wait, no. Because for a node, the 'child' is the first child, and 'sibling' is the next sibling. So, the total nodes in the tree rooted at 'root' is 1 (for root) plus the sum of nodes in each child tree. Each child is the root of a subtree, which can be accessed via the child and sibling pointers.

Wait, no. The 'child' is the first child, and 'sibling' is the next sibling. So, the children are in a linked list. So, the total nodes in the tree is 1 (root) plus the sum of nodes in each child's subtree.

So, the helper function should be:

private int countNodes(BinomialHeapNode root) {
    if (root == null) return 0;
    int count = 1; // root itself
    BinomialHeapNode current = root.child;
    while (current != null) {
        count += countNodes(current);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return count;
}

Wait, no. Because each child is the root of a subtree, and the siblings are other roots of subtrees. So, for each child, we need to add the count of its subtree.

So, the helper function should be:

private int countNodes(BinomialHeapNode root) {
    if (root == null) return 0;
    int count = 1; // root
    BinomialHeapNode current = root.child;
    while (current != null) {
        count += countNodes(current);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return count;
}

Yes, that makes sense.

Then, the total number of nodes is the sum of countNodes for each root node.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

- Collect all root nodes by traversing from 'Nodes' through siblings.
- For each root, add its countNodes to a total.
- Compare total with size.

Now, the cycle check: ensure that the parent pointers do not form cycles. For each node, follow the parent chain until null, ensuring no revisits.

So, for each node, traverse parent, then parent's parent, etc., and keep a set of visited nodes. If any node is revisited, there's a cycle.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks:

1. For each node, check that its key is <= its children's keys (heap property).
2. For each node, check that its degree equals the number of children (binomial tree structure).
3. Collect all root nodes' degrees and ensure they are unique (forest property).
4. Check that the total number of nodes equals the size variable.
5. Ensure that the parent pointers form no cycles.

Now, let's think about how to implement each part.

First, the heap property. For each node, iterate through all its children and ensure that each child's key is >= the node's key.

But wait, in a binomial heap, each node's key is <= its children's keys. So, for each node, check that all its children have keys >= node.key.

But how to get all the children? For a node, the children are in the child and sibling chain. So, for node n, children are n.child, n.child.sibling, etc.

So, for each node, iterate through its children and check the key condition.

Second, the binomial tree structure: for each node, count the number of children and ensure it equals the degree.

Third, the forest property: collect all root nodes' degrees into a set. If the size of the set is less than the number of roots, there are duplicates.

Fourth, the size check: sum the countNodes of all roots and compare to size.

Fifth, the cycle check: for each node, traverse the parent chain and ensure no cycles.

Now, let's outline the code.

First, the repOK method:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check 1: Heap property
    if (!checkHeapProperty()) return false;

    // Check 2: Binomial tree structure
    if (!checkBinomialStructure()) return false;

    // Check 3: Forest property
    if (!checkForestProperty()) return false;

    // Check 4: Size consistency
    if (!checkSizeConsistency()) return false;

    // Check 5: No cycles in parent pointers
    if (!checkNoCycles()) return false;

    return true;
}

Now, implement each helper method.

Check 1: checkHeapProperty()

private boolean checkHeapProperty() {
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        // Check all children of current
        BinomialHeapNode child = current.child;
        while (child != null) {
            if (current.key > child.key) {
                return false;
            }
            child = child.sibling;
        }
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, no. Because each node's children are in the child and sibling chain. So, for each node, we need to check all its children.

Wait, but in the above code, current is a root node, and we're checking its children. But in reality, every node in the heap should satisfy the heap property, not just the roots. So, the above code only checks the roots' children, which is incorrect.

Ah, right. So, I need to traverse every node in the heap and check that each node's key is <= its children's keys.

So, the correct approach is to perform a traversal of all nodes and for each node, check its children.

How to traverse all nodes? Since the heap is a forest, I can start with each root and traverse each tree.

So, the helper method would be:

private boolean checkHeapProperty() {
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        if (!checkHeapPropertyForNode(current)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

private boolean checkHeapPropertyForNode(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    // Check all children of node
    BinomialHeapNode child = node.child;
    while (child != null) {
        if (node.key > child.key) {
            return false;
        }
        // Recursively check the child's heap property
        if (!checkHeapPropertyForNode(child)) {
            return false;
        }
        child = child.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

Yes, this way, every node's children are checked, and the heap property is enforced throughout the entire structure.

Check 2: checkBinomialStructure()

This involves two parts: each node's degree equals the number of children, and the tree structure is valid (each level has the same number of nodes).

First, for each node, count the number of children and compare to degree.

private boolean checkBinomialStructure() {
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        if (!checkBinomialStructureForNode(current)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

private boolean checkBinomialStructureForNode(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    int numChildren = countChildren(node);
    if (numChildren != node.degree) {
        return false;
    }
    // Also check that the tree is a proper binomial tree
    // This is more complex; perhaps we can assume that if the degree equals the number of children, the structure is correct.
    // Alternatively, we can perform a structural check.
    // For the sake of this problem, perhaps checking degree == numChildren is sufficient.
    return true;
}

But wait, the binomial tree structure requires more than just the degree matching the number of children. It also requires that each level of the tree has exactly the same number of nodes. So, for a node of degree d, each level from 0 to d must have exactly one node. Wait, no, that's not correct. A binomial tree of degree d has d children, each of which is the root of a binomial tree of degree d-1, d-2, etc. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of the repOK method, checking that each node's degree equals the number of children is sufficient, as the other structural properties are ensured by the operations.

So, perhaps the above code is sufficient.

Check 3: checkForestProperty()

Collect all root nodes' degrees and ensure they are unique.

private boolean checkForestProperty() {
    Set<Integer> degrees = new HashSet<>();
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        if (degrees.contains(current.degree)) {
            return false;
        }
        degrees.add(current.degree);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

Yes, this ensures that all root nodes have unique degrees.

Check 4: checkSizeConsistency()

Calculate the total number of nodes by summing countNodes for each root, then compare to size.

private boolean checkSizeConsistency() {
    int total = 0;
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        total += countNodes(current);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return total == size;
}

private int countNodes(BinomialHeapNode root) {
    if (root == null) return 0;
    int count = 1;
    BinomialHeapNode current = root.child;
    while (current != null) {
        count += countNodes(current);
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return count;
}

Yes.

Check 5: checkNoCycles()

For each node, traverse the parent chain and ensure no cycles.

private boolean checkNoCycles() {
    Set<BinomialHeapNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
    BinomialHeapNode current = Nodes;
    while (current != null) {
        if (!traverseParents(current, visited)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.sibling;
    }
    return true;
}

private boolean traverseParents(BinomialHeapNode node, Set<BinomialHeapNode> visited) {
    if (visited.contains(node)) {
        return false;
    }
    visited.add(node);
    if (node.parent != null) {
        return traverseParents(node.parent, visited);
    }
    return true;
}

This ensures that each node's parent chain does not form a
