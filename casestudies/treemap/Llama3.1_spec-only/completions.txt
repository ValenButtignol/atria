The TreeMap class represents a self-balancing binary search tree data structure. It stores key-value pairs and provides efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

Attributes:

- root: The root node of the tree.
- comparator: A comparator used to compare keys, or null if the keys are Comparable.
- size: The number of key-value pairs in the tree.

Methods:

- put(K key, V value): Inserts a new key-value pair into the tree. If the key already exists, its value is updated.
- size(): Returns the number of key-value pairs in the tree.
- isEmpty(): Returns true if the tree is empty, false otherwise.
- clear(): Removes all key-value pairs from the tree.

Constraints:

- The tree is self-balancing, ensuring that the height of the tree remains relatively small even after insertions and deletions.
- The tree maintains the following properties:
  - All nodes are either red or black.
  - The root node is black.
  - All leaf nodes are black.
  - If a node is red, both its children must be black.
  - For any node, all paths from the node to its leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes.

Purpose:

- The TreeMap class provides an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs, with an average time complexity of O(log n) for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

```java
/**
 * Represents the invariant of the TreeMap class.
 * 
 * @return true if the tree is in a valid state, false otherwise.
 */
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the tree is self-balancing
    return isSelfBalancing(root);

    // Check if the tree maintains the red-black tree properties
    return isRedBlackTree(root);

    // Check if the size of the tree is consistent with its nodes
    return size == countNodes(root);
}

// Helper method to check if the tree is self-balancing
private boolean isSelfBalancing(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int heightLeft = getHeight(root.left);
    int heightRight = getHeight(root.right);
    return Math.abs(heightLeft - heightRight) <= 1 && isSelfBalancing(root.left) && isSelfBalancing(root.right);
}

// Helper method to check if the tree maintains the red-black tree properties
private boolean isRedBlackTree(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (root.color == Color.RED && (root.left != null && root.left.color == Color.RED || root.right != null && root.right.color == Color.RED)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root.color == Color.RED && root.left != null && root.left.color == Color.RED && root.right != null && root.right.color == Color.RED) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root.color == Color.BLACK && root.left != null && root.left.color == Color.RED || root.right != null && root.right.color == Color.RED) {
        return false;
    }
    return isRedBlackTree(root.left) && isRedBlackTree(root.right);
}

// Helper method to count the number of nodes in the tree
private int countNodes(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
}

// Helper method to get the height of a node
private int getHeight(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + Math.max(getHeight(root.left), getHeight(root.right));
}

// Enum for node colors
enum Color {
    RED, BLACK
}

// Node class
class Node {
    int key;
    int value;
    Color color;
    Node left;
    Node right;
}
```

This `repOK` method checks the following invariants:

1.  The tree is self-balancing, ensuring that the height of the tree remains relatively small even after insertions and deletions.
2.  The tree maintains the red-black tree properties:
    *   All nodes are either red or black.
    *   The root node is black.
    *   All leaf nodes are black.
    *   If a node is red, both its children must be black.
    *   For any node, all paths from the node to its leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes.
3.  The size of the tree is consistent with its nodes.

These invariants ensure that the TreeMap class provides an efficient way to store and retrieve key-value pairs, with an average time complexity of O(log n) for search, insertion, and deletion operations.
