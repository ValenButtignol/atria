To write the `repOK` method for the `LinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the representation invariant holds true. The `repOK` method should check the following conditions:

1. The `header` node should be correctly linked to itself.
2. The `size` of the list should be consistent with the number of elements in the list.
3. Each node in the list should have its `next` and `previous` pointers correctly set.

Here is the `repOK` method for the `LinkedList` class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header is correctly linked to itself
    if (header.next != header || header.previous != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the size is consistent with the number of elements
    int count = 0;
    for (Entry e = header.next; e != header; e = e.next) {
        count++;
    }
    if (count != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if each node has its next and previous pointers correctly set
    for (Entry e = header.next; e != header; e = e.next) {
        if (e.previous.next != e || e.next.previous != e) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header Check**: The `header` node should be correctly linked to itself. This means `header.next` and `header.previous` should both point to `header`.

2. **Size Check**: We iterate through the list starting from `header.next` and count the number of nodes until we reach `header` again. This count should match the `size` attribute of the list.

3. **Node Linking Check**: For each node in the list, we check that its `next` and `previous` pointers correctly point to the next and previous nodes, respectively. This ensures that the list is properly linked.

By implementing the `repOK` method in this way, we can verify that the representation invariant holds true for the `LinkedList` class.
