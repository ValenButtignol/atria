Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me start by understanding what this class does. From the code, it looks like it's a linked list that caches nodes to avoid creating new ones unnecessarily. The class has a header node, a size, a default maximum cache size, a first cached node, a cache size, and a maximum cache size.

The methods include add, remove, and some helper methods for adding and removing nodes, managing the cache. The add method adds a node to the end, and the remove method searches for a node and removes it, also adding it back to the cache if possible.

So, the invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I need to make sure it only checks properties I'm certain are valid.

First, I should think about what makes the object invalid. The main issues could be:

1. **Cache consistency**: The cache should not exceed the maximum size. Also, when a node is added to the cache, it should correctly link to the previous cached node and update the firstCachedNode.

2. **Node presence in the cache**: When a node is added, it should either be in the cache or in the linked list. If it's in the cache, its value should be updated correctly.

3. **Linked list integrity**: The nodes should form a proper linked list with correct previous and next pointers.

4. **Size consistency**: The size of the linked list and the cache should be accurate.

Let me outline the checks:

- **Cache not full**: If the cache is full, adding a new node should either replace the first node or not be possible.
- **Cache size within limits**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum.
- **No duplicates in cache**: Each node in the cache should have a unique value.
- **Proper linking in cache**: The cached nodes should form a contiguous block in the linked list.
- **Proper linking in the list**: All nodes should have correct previous and next pointers, except for the header and the last node.

Wait, but the cache is managed separately. So, when a node is added to the cache, it's taken out of the main list. So, the main list should not have those nodes anymore.

Hmm, perhaps I should check that the nodes in the cache are not present in the main list. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, I can check that the cache doesn't have more nodes than allowed and that each node in the cache has the correct links.

Also, when a node is removed from the main list, it's added back to the cache if there's space. So, the cache should not have more nodes than the maximum size.

Another point: when adding a node to the cache, it's linked after the firstCachedNode. So, the cache should form a contiguous sequence starting from the firstCachedNode.

I should also ensure that the size of the linked list and the cache are correctly updated.

Let me think about how to implement this in the repOK method.

I can start by checking if the cache is full. If it is, adding a new node should either replace the first node or throw an error.

Wait, but the add method handles the cache size. So, in repOK, I can check if the cache size is greater than the maximum. If it is, return false.

Also, I need to ensure that the cache doesn't have duplicate values. So, I can iterate through the cache nodes and check for duplicates.

Another thing: the firstCachedNode should point to the next node in the cache. So, if the cache is not empty, firstCachedNode.next should be the second node, and so on.

Wait, but the cache is a contiguous block in the linked list. So, the firstCachedNode's next should be the second cached node, and the last cached node's next should be null or point to the end of the list.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to check that the cache forms a proper sequence.

Also, when a node is added to the cache, it's taken out of the main list. So, the main list should not contain any nodes that are in the cache.

Wait, but the main list can have nodes that are not in the cache. So, perhaps I need to ensure that the nodes in the cache are not present in the main list.

But that might be too complex. Maybe it's sufficient to check that the cache doesn't have duplicates and that it doesn't exceed the maximum size.

Additionally, I should check that the linked list's size is correct. For example, after adding or removing nodes, the size should reflect the actual number of nodes.

Let me outline the steps for repOK:

1. Check if the cache size is greater than the maximum. If yes, return false.
2. Check if the cache has any duplicates. If yes, return false.
3. Check that the cache forms a contiguous block in the linked list. That is, firstCachedNode.next should be the second node, and so on.
4. Ensure that the linked list's size is correct, considering the cache.

Wait, but the linked list's size includes both the cache and the non-cached nodes. So, the total size should be the sum of the cache size and the non-cached nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check that the cache nodes are correctly linked and that their values are unique.

I think I'll proceed with the following checks:

- Cache size <= maximum.
- No duplicates in the cache.
- The cache forms a contiguous block in the linked list.
- The linked list's size is consistent with the cache size.

Wait, but the linked list's size is maintained separately. So, perhaps I should check that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list, which should be size = (size of linked list) + (cache size - number of nodes in cache that are not in the linked list).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to focus on the cache and the linked list separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check:

- The cache is not full beyond the maximum size.
- The cache has unique values.
- The cache nodes are properly linked in the list.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for similar invariants in the previous examples.

In the MinHeap example, the repOK method checked that each node's children were greater than or equal to it. For the BinTree, it checked acyclic, ordered, no duplicates, etc.

For the NodeCachingLinkedList, the main issues are cache management and linked list integrity.

So, perhaps the repOK method should:

1. Check that the cache size does not exceed the maximum.
2. Check that the cache does not have duplicate values.
3. Check that the cache nodes are properly linked in the list.
4. Check that the linked list's size is correct.

Wait, but the linked list's size is maintained by the size variable. So, perhaps I can check that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list, considering the cache.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check the cache and the linked list separately.

I think I'll proceed with the following:

- Check that the cache size is <= maximum.
- Check that the cache has no duplicates.
- Check that the cache nodes form a contiguous block in the linked list.
- Check that the linked list's size is correct.

But how to implement this?

For the cache size, it's straightforward: if cacheSize > maximumCacheSize, return false.

For duplicates, iterate through the cache nodes and check if any two have the same value.

For the contiguous block, check that firstCachedNode.next is the second node, and so on until the end of the cache.

For the linked list size, perhaps check that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list, which is size = (size of linked list) + (cache size - number of cache nodes that are not in the linked list).

Wait, but the linked list includes both the cache and non-cache nodes. So, the size variable should be equal to the number of nodes in the linked list.

Wait, no. The size variable is maintained separately. When a node is added to the cache, it's removed from the linked list, so the size decreases by 1. When a node is added to the linked list, the size increases by 1.

So, the size variable accurately reflects the number of nodes in the linked list.

Therefore, perhaps I don't need to check the linked list size separately.

So, the main checks are:

1. Cache size <= maximum.
2. Cache has no duplicates.
3. Cache nodes are properly linked.

Let me think about how to implement these.

For the cache size:

if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) return false;

For duplicates:

Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
for (LinkedListNode node = firstCachedNode; node != null; node = node.next) {
    if (seen.contains(node.getValue())) return false;
    seen.add(node.getValue());
}

Wait, but the cache is a contiguous block. So, I can iterate from firstCachedNode to the end.

For the contiguous block:

if (firstCachedNode != null) {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    // Now, current should be the last node in the cache.
    // Also, check that current.next is null or points to the end of the list.
    // But perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache forms a contiguous block.
}

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache nodes are properly linked without checking the entire list.

I think I'll proceed with the following:

In the repOK method:

1. Check that the cache size does not exceed the maximum.
2. Check that the cache does not have duplicate values.
3. Check that the cache nodes form a contiguous block in the linked list.

Additionally, ensure that the linked list's size is correct, but since the size variable is maintained, perhaps it's not necessary.

Wait, but the size variable includes both the cache and the non-cache nodes. So, if the cache has N nodes, and the linked list has M nodes, size = M + (N - C), where C is the number of cache nodes that are not in the linked list.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to trust the size variable as it's maintained by the class.

So, the repOK method will:

- Check cache size <= maximum.
- Check cache has no duplicates.
- Check that the cache nodes are properly linked.

Now, how to implement checking that the cache nodes are properly linked.

The cache should form a contiguous block starting from firstCachedNode. So, the next of firstCachedNode should be the second node, and so on until the last node, whose next should be null or point to the end of the list.

But perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache nodes are properly linked without checking the entire list.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the firstCachedNode's next is the second node, and the last node's next is null.

But that might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache nodes are correctly added and that their previous and next pointers are set correctly.

But I'm not sure.

Perhaps for the purposes of the repOK method, it's sufficient to check that the cache size is correct, no duplicates, and that the cache nodes are properly linked in the list.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check for duplicates in cache
    Set<Object> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        Object value = current.getValue();
        if (seenValues.contains(value)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenValues.add(value);
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check that the cache forms a contiguous block
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode previousCachedNode = null;
        current = firstCachedNode;
        while (current != null) {
            // Check that current's previous is the previousCachedNode
            if (current.previous != previousCachedNode) {
                return false;
            }
            previousCachedNode = current;
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, if the cache is empty, it's fine. If the cache has one node, it's fine.

But when the cache has multiple nodes, each node's previous should point to the previous node in the cache, and the next should point to the next node.

Also, the last node in the cache should have next as null or pointing to the end of the list.

But perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache nodes are properly linked in the list.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to check that the cache nodes are correctly inserted into the linked list.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to check that the cache nodes are properly linked without checking the entire list.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that the cache nodes are correctly added and that their previous and next pointers are set correctly.

But I'm not sure how to implement that efficiently.

Perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the repOK method can check the cache size, no duplicates, and that the cache nodes are properly linked in the list.

So, the code I wrote earlier should suffice.

I think that's a reasonable approach.
</think>

To determine the representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the cache adheres to specific constraints and that the linked list maintains its integrity. The invariant should verify the following:

1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum allowed size.
2. **No Duplicates in Cache**: Each value in the cache must be unique.
3. **Contiguous Cache Block**: The cache nodes should form a contiguous block within the linked list, ensuring proper linking.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the cache size exceeds the maximum allowed
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check for duplicates in the cache
    Set<Object> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        Object value = current.getValue();
        if (seenValues.contains(value)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenValues.add(value);
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check that the cache forms a contiguous block in the linked list
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode previousCachedNode = null;
        current = firstCachedNode;
        while (current != null) {
            // Ensure each node's previous pointer correctly points to the previous node in the cache
            if (current.previous != previousCachedNode) {
                return false;
            }
            previousCachedNode = current;
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

This method ensures that the cache operates within its constraints and that the linked list maintains the integrity of the cache nodes.
