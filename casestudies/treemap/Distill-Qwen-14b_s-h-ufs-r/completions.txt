Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the TreeMap class. The repOK method should check the internal state of the tree to ensure it's valid according to the properties of a balanced binary search tree, specifically a red-black tree.

First, I remember that in a red-black tree, each node is either red or black. The root must be black. Every left and right child of a red node must be black. The path from any node to a leaf must have the same number of black nodes. Also, no two red nodes can be adjacent except as parent and child.

So, the repOK method should verify these properties.

I'll start by checking if the root is null. If the tree is empty, it's valid. Otherwise, the root must be black.

Next, I'll traverse each node to check the color properties. For every node, if it's red, both its left and right children must be black. Also, each node's parent should not be null unless it's the root.

I also need to ensure that the size is correct. The size variable should match the actual number of nodes in the tree. So, I'll perform a traversal (like in-order or pre-order) to count the nodes and compare it with the size.

Additionally, I should check that the tree is balanced in terms of black height. This might be more complex, but perhaps for the repOK, it's sufficient to check the basic structural properties without the balance, unless the class enforces strict balance.

Wait, the user's example for the MinHeap and LinkedList included specific checks. For the TreeMap, the repOK should include all the invariants of a red-black tree.

So, putting it all together:

1. Check if root is null when size is 0, else root is black.
2. For each node, if it's red, its children must be black.
3. Each node's parent must be set correctly, except root.
4. The size must equal the actual number of nodes.
5. The tree must be a valid binary search tree based on the comparator.

I think the last point is more about the BST property, which is separate from the red-black properties. But for repOK, perhaps it's enough to check the structural invariants of the red-black tree, not the BST order, since the BST property is enforced by the put method.

So, focusing on the red-black properties:

- The root is black.
- Every left and right child of a red node is black.
- No two consecutive red nodes (except parent and child).
- All paths from root to leaves have the same number of black nodes.

Wait, the last point is about the black height. Checking that might be complicated. Maybe for the repOK, it's sufficient to check the first three points and the size.

Alternatively, perhaps the size check is enough for structural integrity, but I'm not sure. It's better to include as many invariants as possible that can be checked.

So, the repOK method will:

- Check if root is null when size is 0, else root is black.
- For each node, if it's red, its children must be null or black.
- Ensure that no two consecutive nodes are red in the parent-child relationship.
- Verify that the size is correct.

Wait, but checking for consecutive red nodes is tricky. Because a node can have a red child, but the parent is red, which is allowed as long as the child's children are black. So, perhaps the main checks are:

- Root is black.
- For every node, if it's red, its children are black.
- All paths from root to leaves have the same number of black nodes (black height).
- Size is correct.

But checking the black height for every path is computationally expensive. Maybe for the repOK, it's better to check the simpler properties and leave the more complex ones for another time.

Alternatively, perhaps the size check is sufficient for structural integrity, but I'm not sure. It's better to include as many as possible.

So, the steps in the repOK method:

1. If size is 0, check that root is null.
2. Else, check that root is black.
3. Traverse each node:
   a. If the node is red, check that both left and right children are either null or black.
   b. Also, check that the parent is correctly set (except root).
4. Check that the size is equal to the actual number of nodes in the tree.

Wait, but how to traverse each node? Maybe perform a BFS or DFS.

So, in code:

- If size is 0, return root == null.
- Else, check root.color is BLACK.
- Then, traverse all nodes (using a queue or stack), for each node:
   - If node is RED, check left and right are either null or BLACK.
   - Also, check that node.parent is not null unless it's the root.
- Then, count the nodes during traversal and compare with size.

Wait, but the size is already tracked, so perhaps the count is redundant. But it's a good check to ensure that the size variable is correct.

So, putting this into code:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size != 0 && root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root.color != BLACK) {
        return false;
    }
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);
    int count = 0;
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.remove();
        count++;
        if (current.parent != null && current.parent.color == RED) {
            // Check if current is the only child and is BLACK
            if (current.color != BLACK) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        if (current.color == RED) {
            if (current.left != null && current.left.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
            if (current.right != null && current.right.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }
    return count == size;
}

Wait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, it doesn't check that all paths have the same number of black nodes. Also, the parent check might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to perform a depth-first traversal and track the black height.

But that might be complicated. Maybe for the repOK, it's better to include the main structural checks: root is black, no two reds in a row (except parent and child), and size is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.

Wait, in the code above, the part where if current.parent is RED, then current must be BLACK. That's correct because in a red-black tree, a red node's parent must be black, but wait no: in a red-black tree, a red node's parent can be red only if it's the root, but the root is black. Wait, no: the root is always black. So, any node's parent cannot be red if the node is red, except if the node is the root, but the root is black. So, any node with a red parent must be black.

Wait, no: in a red-black tree, a node can have a red parent only if the parent is red, but then the node must be black. Because two reds cannot be consecutive except as parent and child. Wait, no: the rule is that no two red nodes can be adjacent except as parent and child. So, a red node's parent can be red only if the child is the root, but the root is black. So, in reality, a node's parent cannot be red if the node is red, except for the root, which is black.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that a node cannot have two red ancestors in a row. So, the code above checks that if a node's parent is red, then the node must be black. That's correct.

So, the code in the repOK method:

- Checks root is black.
- For each node, if parent is red, node must be black.
- For each node, if it's red, its children must be black.
- Counts the nodes and checks against size.

This should cover the main invariants.

But wait, what about the case where a node is red and has a red child? The code checks that if a node is red, its children must be black. So that's covered.

Also, the code ensures that the size is correct.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would look like this.

    if (root.color != BLACK) {

    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);
    int count = 0;

        Node current = queue.remove();

            if (current.left != null && current.left.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
            if (current.right != null && current.right.color == RED) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }
    return count == size;
}
```
