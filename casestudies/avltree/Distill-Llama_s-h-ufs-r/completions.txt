Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Let me first understand what the AvlTree does. It's a balanced binary search tree using rotations to maintain balance. The key properties are that each node's left subtree is at most one node taller than the right subtree, and vice versa, within a certain allowed imbalance.

So, the repOK method should check if the tree is correctly balanced according to these rules. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll need to traverse the tree and calculate the heights of each node. Then, for each node, I'll check the allowed imbalance. The allowed imbalance is set to 1, meaning the left can be at most one taller than the right, and the right can be at most one taller than the left.

Wait, but in the balance method, it's checking if the left is more than one taller than the right and then rotating. So, for each node, the left and right subtrees should not differ in height by more than one.

So, in the repOK method, for each node, I need to ensure that the height of the left child minus the height of the right child is not greater than 1, and similarly, the height of the right child minus the left child is not greater than 1.

But how do I calculate the heights? I can write a helper method to compute the height of a node recursively.

Wait, the AvlNode class has a height field. So, each node knows its own height. That makes it easier.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

1. Check if the root is null. If it is, the tree is empty, which is valid.
2. Traverse each node in the tree.
3. For each node, check the heights of its left and right children.
4. Ensure that the difference in heights is within the allowed imbalance.
5. If any node violates this, return false.
6. If all nodes are okay, return true.

But wait, the allowed imbalance is 1, but the balance method allows for some imbalance during rotations. So, the invariant should check that the tree is balanced according to the rules.

Let me outline the code structure.

The method will be a boolean method called repOK in the AvlTree class.

First, check if the root is null. If so, return true.

Then, for each node starting from the root, check the left and right children's heights.

Wait, but the root's left and right children can have a height difference of up to 1. Similarly, for each node, its left and right children must not differ by more than 1 in height.

So, the code could look like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check each node's balance
    return checkBalance(root);
}

Then, write a helper method checkBalance that recursively checks each node.

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check left and right children
    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : -1;

    // Check if the difference is more than allowed
    if (leftHeight - rightHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    if (rightHeight - leftHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recurse on children
    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}

Wait, but the allowed imbalance is 1, so the difference should not exceed 1 in either direction.

Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, in the balance method, when a node is rotated, it's adjusted to maintain the balance. So, the invariant should hold after any insertion or deletion.

So, the repOK method should accurately reflect the current state of the tree.

Another thing to consider: the height of a node is correctly maintained after each rotation. So, the height fields are up-to-date.

I think this approach should work. Now, let me write the code.

Wait, but in the AvlTree class, the static ALLOWED_IMBALANCE is 1. So, I can use that directly.

So, the repOK method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return checkBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : -1;

    if (leftHeight - rightHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    if (rightHeight - leftHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}

Wait, but what about the root's children? For example, if the root's left is taller than the right by more than one, it should return false.

Yes, that's covered.

I think this should correctly check the balance invariant.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The AvlTree is a balanced binary search tree that maintains balance using rotations. The key property is that each node's left subtree is at most one node taller than the right subtree, and vice versa, within a certain allowed imbalance.

### Approach
The representation invariant, `repOK`, will check if the tree is correctly balanced according to the rules defined for the AvlTree. The method will:
1. Check if the root is null, which means the tree is empty and valid.
2. Traverse each node in the tree.
3. For each node, check the heights of its left and right children.
4. Ensure that the difference in heights between the left and right children is within the allowed imbalance.
5. If any node violates this balance, the method returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

### Solution Code
```java
package casestudies.avltree;

public class AvlTree {
    static final int ALLOWED_IMBALANCE = 1;
    public AvlNode root;

    public AvlTree() {
        root = null;
    }

    public void insert(int x) {
        root = insert(x, root);
    }

    public void remove(int x) {
        root = remove(x, root);
    }

    private AvlNode remove(int x, AvlNode t) {
        if (t == null)
            return t;

        if (x < t.element)
            t.left = remove(x, t.left);
        else if (x > t.element)
            t.right = remove(x, t.right);
        else if (t.left != null && t.right != null) {
            t.element = findMin(t.right).element;

        } else
            t = (t.left != null) ? t.left : t.right;
        return balance(t);
    }

        if (isEmpty())
            throw new RuntimeException();
        return findMin(root).element;
    }

    public boolean isEmpty() {

    }

    private AvlNode balance(AvlNode t) {
        if (t == null)
            return t;

        if (height(t.left) - height(t.right) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE)
            if (height(t.left.left) >= height(t.left.right))
                t = rotateWithLeftChild(t);
            else
                t = doubleWithLeftChild(t);
        else if (height(t.right) - height(t.left) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE)
            if (height(t.right.right) >= height(t.right.left))
                t = rotateWithRightChild(t);
            else
                t = doubleWithRightChild(t);

        t.height = Math.max(height(t.left), height(t.right)) + 1;
        return t;
    }

    private AvlNode insert(int x, AvlNode t) {
        if (t == null)
            return new AvlNode(x, null, null);

        if (x < t.element)
            t.left = insert(x, t.left);
        else if (x > t.element)
            t.right = insert(x, t.right);
        else
            ;
        return balance(t);
    }

    private AvlNode findMin(AvlNode t) {
        if (t == null)

        while (t.left != null)
            t = t.left;
        return t;
    }

    private int height(AvlNode t) {
        return t == null ? -1 : t.height;
    }

    private AvlNode rotateWithLeftChild(AvlNode k2) {
        AvlNode k1 = k2.left;
        k2.left = k1.right;
        k1.right = k2;
        k2.height = Math.max(height(k2.left), height(k2.right)) + 1;
        k1.height = Math.max(height(k1.left), k2.height) + 1;
        return k1;
    }

    private AvlNode rotateWithRightChild(AvlNode k1) {
        AvlNode k2 = k1.right;
        k1.right = k2.left;
        k2.left = k1;
        k1.height = Math.max(height(k1.left), height(k1.right)) + 1;
        k2.height = Math.max(height(k2.right), k1.height) + 1;
        return k2;
    }

    private AvlNode doubleWithLeftChild(AvlNode k3) {
        k3.left = rotateWithRightChild(k3.left);
        return rotateWithLeftChild(k3);
    }

    private AvlNode doubleWithRightChild(AvlNode k1) {
        k1.right = rotateWithLeftChild(k1.right);
        return rotateWithRightChild(k1);
    }

    public static class AvlNode {
        public int element;
        public AvlNode left;
        public AvlNode right;
        public int height;

        public AvlNode() {
        }

        public AvlNode(int theElement) {
            this(theElement, null, null);
        }

        public AvlNode(int theElement, AvlNode lt, AvlNode rt) {
            element = theElement;
            left = lt;
            right = rt;
            height = 0;
        }
    }
}

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return checkBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : -1;

    if (leftHeight - rightHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    if (rightHeight - leftHeight > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}
```

### Explanation
The `repOK` method checks if the AvlTree is balanced according to the allowed imbalance. It starts by checking if the root is null, which is valid. Then, it recursively checks each node to ensure that the height difference between the left and right children does not exceed the allowed imbalance. If any node violates this condition, the method returns false, indicating the tree is not balanced. If all nodes satisfy the condition, the method returns true, confirming the tree is balanced.
