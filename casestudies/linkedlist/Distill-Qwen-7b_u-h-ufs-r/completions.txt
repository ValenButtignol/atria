Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the LinkedList class in Java. The representation invariant is a boolean method that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the LinkedList class structure. It has a header entry which is a dummy node, and a size variable. The class uses a linked list to store elements, with each Entry containing the element, a next pointer, and a previous pointer.

I should think about the key properties that must hold for the linked list to be valid.

1. **Size Consistency**: The size should always reflect the number of entries in the list. So, if I traverse from the header, the number of non-header entries should equal the size.

2. **Non-null Header**: The header should always be present and not null. This ensures that the list isn't empty unless the size is zero.

3. **Next and Previous Pointers**: Each non-header Entry should have a non-null next and previous pointer. Except for the header and the last node, which should have null pointers appropriately.

4. **No dangling entries**: There should be no entries that are not properly linked. So, if an entry has a non-null previous, its previous's next should point back to it, and similarly for next.

5. **No null pointers in size or capacity**: The size should never be negative, and the capacity (if any) should be handled correctly, but in this class, I don't see a capacity variable, so maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, looking at the LinkedList code, I see that the header is always present, and size is an int that starts at 0. The add and remove methods modify the size correctly.

So, the key points are:

- The header is always present.
- The size is correct.
- Each entry (except header) has a non-null next and previous.
- The last entry's next is null.
- The first entry's previous is null.

Let me think about how to translate these into code.

First, the header is always present, so checking if header is null should return false unless size is 0.

Then, the size should be equal to the number of entries after the header. So, if I traverse from header.next, the number of entries should be equal to size.

Each entry (except header) should have non-null next and previous.

The header's previous should be null, and its next should be the first entry.

The last entry's next should be null, and its previous should point to the second last entry.

Putting this together, the repOK method should:

1. Check if header is null and size is not zero. If header is null and size is zero, it's okay. If header is null and size >0, it's invalid.

2. Check that the number of entries (from header.next) equals size.

3. Check that each entry (except header) has non-null next and previous.

4. Check that the header's previous is null.

5. Check that the header's next is not null if size >0.

6. Check that the last entry's next is null.

7. Check that the last entry's previous is not null if size >0.

Wait, but how do I find the last entry? I can traverse from header.next until the next is null. The last entry would be the one before that.

Alternatively, I can traverse from header.next, and for each entry, check that next is not null, until I reach the end.

But in the repOK method, I can't have loops because it's supposed to be a method, not a loop-based check. Wait, no, the repOK method can have loops as long as it's a boolean return.

Wait, no, the repOK method is supposed to be a method that returns a boolean, so it can have loops as part of its logic.

So, I can write loops to check each of these conditions.

Let me outline the steps in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if header is null and size is not zero
    if (header == null && size != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if size is consistent with the number of entries
    int actualSize = 0;
    Entry current = header.next;
    do {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current != header); // Wait, no, this loop would run forever because current starts at header.next, and the condition is current != header, which is always true unless current is null.

    Wait, no, the do-while loop should be:

    Entry current = header.next;
    do {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current != null);

    Because if current is null, the loop stops.

    Then, compare actualSize with size. If they don't match, return false.

    Then, check that each entry (except header) has non-null next and previous.

    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.next == null || current.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    Then, check that header's previous is null.

    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    Then, check that header's next is not null if size >0.

    if (size > 0 && header.next == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Then, find the last entry and check that its next is null and its previous is not null if size >0.

    Entry last = null;
    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        last = current;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (last != null) {
        if (last.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (size > 0 && last.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    Wait, but if size is zero, last would be null, so the checks inside the if (last != null) block are skipped.

    So, putting it all together:

    public boolean repOK() {
        // Check if header is null and size is not zero
        if (header == null && size != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check if size matches the number of entries
        int actualSize = 0;
        Entry current = header.next;
        do {
            actualSize++;
            current = current.next;
        } while (current != null);

        if (actualSize != size) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check each entry (except header) has non-null next and previous
        current = header.next;
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.next == null || current.previous == null) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        // Check header's previous is null
        if (header.previous != null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check header's next is not null if size >0
        if (size > 0 && header.next == null) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check last entry's next is null and previous is not null if size >0
        Entry last = null;
        current = header.next;
        while (current != null) {
            last = current;
            current = current.next;
        }
        if (last != null) {
            if (last.next != null) {
                return false;
            }
            if (size > 0 && last.previous == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
</think>

public boolean repOK() {
    if (header == null && size != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    int actualSize = 0;
    Entry current = header.next;
    do {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current != null);

    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.next == null || current.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    if (size > 0 && header.next == null) {
        return false;
    }

    Entry last = null;
    current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        last = current;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (last != null) {
        if (last.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (size > 0 && last.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
