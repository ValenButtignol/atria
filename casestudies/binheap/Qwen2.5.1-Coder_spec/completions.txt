### Specification:

**Class: BinomialHeap**

**Attributes:**
- `Nodes`: A reference to the root of the binomial heap.
- `size`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the heap.

**Methods:**
- `BinomialHeap()`: Constructor to initialize an empty binomial heap.
- `insert(int value)`: Inserts a new node with the given value into the heap.
- `delete(int value)`: Deletes a node with the given value from the heap.
- `extractMin()`: Removes and returns the node with the minimum key from the heap.
- `findMinimum()`: Returns the key of the node with the minimum key in the heap.
- `decreaseKeyValue(int old_value, int new_value)`: Decreases the key of a node with the given old value to the new value.

**Behavior:**
- The heap maintains the binomial heap property, where each node is a tree with a degree, and the root of each tree has a key less than or equal to the keys of its children.
- The `insert` method adds a new node to the heap, maintaining the heap property.
- The `delete` method finds the node with the given value, decreases its key to the minimum possible value, and then extracts the minimum node.
- The `extractMin` method removes and returns the node with the smallest key, merging the remaining trees to maintain the heap property.
- The `findMinimum` method returns the key of the node with the smallest key.
- The `decreaseKeyValue` method decreases the key of a node with the given old value to the new value, maintaining the heap property.

**Constraints:**
- The heap size is updated correctly after each insertion and deletion.
- The `extractMin` method throws an `IllegalStateException` if the heap is empty.
- The `decreaseKeyValue` method throws an `IllegalStateException` if the heap is empty.

To ensure the correctness of the `BinomialHeap` class, we need to define a representation invariant that captures the essential properties of the heap. The representation invariant should hold true before and after any operation on the heap. Here is the `repOK` method for the `BinomialHeap` class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the root node is null or satisfies the binomial heap property
    if (Nodes != null) {
        if (!isBinomialHeap(Nodes)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check if the size matches the number of nodes in the heap
    if (size != countNodes(Nodes)) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private boolean isBinomialHeap(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    // Check if the node is a valid binomial tree
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if the degree of the node is non-negative
    if (node.degree < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the key of the node is less than or equal to the keys of its children
    if ((node.child != null) && (node.key > node.child.key)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the sibling nodes are valid binomial trees
    if ((node.sibling != null) && (node.degree >= node.sibling.degree)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check the children and siblings
    return isBinomialHeap(node.child) && isBinomialHeap(node.sibling);
}

private int countNodes(BinomialHeapNode node) {
    // Count the number of nodes in the heap
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }

    return 1 + countNodes(node.child) + countNodes(node.sibling);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Size Check**: The `size` attribute should be non-negative. If it is negative, the heap is in an invalid state.

2. **Root Node Check**: The root node (`Nodes`) should either be `null` or satisfy the binomial heap property. The `isBinomialHeap` method checks if a given node is a valid binomial tree by ensuring:
   - The degree of the node is non-negative.
   - The key of the node is less than or equal to the keys of its children.
   - The sibling nodes are valid binomial trees and have a strictly greater degree than the current node.

3. **Size Consistency Check**: The `size` attribute should match the actual number of nodes in the heap. The `countNodes` method recursively counts the number of nodes in the heap.

By ensuring these conditions hold, the `repOK` method verifies that the `BinomialHeap` class maintains its representation invariant.
