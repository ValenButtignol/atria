Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class in Java. The representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the BinTree class. It has a private Node root and an int size. The add method adds nodes recursively, and there's a getSize method that returns the size. The Node class has left, right, and info fields.

What properties should I check? Let's think:

1. The size should always equal the number of nodes in the tree. So, when a node is added, size increments by 1. But I need to ensure that this holds throughout the class's operations.

2. The root should be null if the tree is empty. Otherwise, it points to the top node.

3. The add method should correctly build the tree structure. But verifying the correctness of the add method might be complex, so maybe I'll focus on the size and root properties.

4. The size should never be negative, but since size is initialized to 0 and only increments, this is probably always true.

So, the key properties are:

- The size is correct, i.e., it equals the number of nodes.
- The root is null when the tree is empty.
- The root is not null when the tree has nodes.

I can write repOK to check these. It should return false if any of these conditions are violated.

Wait, but how do I count the number of nodes? The size is maintained, but perhaps I should count the nodes by traversing the tree recursively to ensure that size is accurate. That might be a bit involved, but it's necessary for the invariant.

Alternatively, I can assume that the add and addRecursive methods correctly manage the size, but that's risky. It's better to verify it.

So, in repOK, I'll:

- Check if root is null. If size > 0, root must not be null.
- If root is not null, traverse the tree and count the nodes to ensure it matches the size.

But wait, traversing the tree for every repOK call might be inefficient, but for the invariant, it's necessary to ensure correctness.

Alternatively, I can have a helper method that counts the nodes and compares it to size.

So, the steps for repOK are:

1. If size is 0, root must be null.
2. If size > 0, root must not be null.
3. Traverse the tree and count the nodes to ensure it equals size.

I'll implement this in repOK.

Another consideration: the add method might have bugs, but since I can't easily test it, I'll focus on the size and root properties.

So, the repOK method will:

- Check if (size == 0) implies (root == null).
- Check if (size > 0) implies (root != null).
- Traverse the tree to count nodes and compare with size.

I'll write the helper method countNodes that recursively counts the nodes in the tree.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks and return false if any condition fails.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size == 0 && root != null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size > 0 && root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    int actualSize = countNodes(root);
    return actualSize == size;
}

private int countNodes(Node current) {
    if (current == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(current.left) + countNodes(current.right);
}
```
