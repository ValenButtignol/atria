The LinkedList class represents a dynamic collection of elements, where each element is linked to its predecessor and successor in the sequence. 

Attributes:
- header: a sentinel node that serves as the first and last element in the list.
- size: the number of elements in the list.

Methods:
- add(Object o): adds a new element to the end of the list.
- remove(Object o): removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.
- clear(): removes all elements from the list.
- size(): returns the number of elements in the list.

Constraints:
- The list is a circularly linked list, where the header node is both the first and last element.
- The list does not allow null elements.
- The remove method throws a NoSuchElementException if the specified element is not found in the list.

Purpose:
- The LinkedList class provides a basic implementation of a dynamic collection, allowing elements to be added and removed efficiently.

### Representation Invariant for LinkedList Class

```java
/**
 * Represents the invariant of the LinkedList class.
 * 
 * @return true if the representation invariant holds, false otherwise.
 */
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the list is not empty
    if (size() == 0) {
        // If the list is empty, the header node should be the only node in the list
        return header == header.getPrev() && header == header.getNext();
    } else {
        // If the list is not empty, check the following conditions
        // Check if the header node is the first and last element in the list
        if (header != header.getPrev() || header != header.getNext()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if all nodes in the list are linked correctly
        Node prev = header.getPrev();
        Node curr = header;
        for (int i = 0; i < size() - 1; i++) {
            if (curr == null || curr.getNext() != prev) {
                return false;
            }
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr.getNext();
        }
        
        // Check if the last node is linked to the header node
        if (curr != header) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if the list does not contain any null elements
        for (Node node = header; node != header; node = node.getNext()) {
            if (node.getElement() == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // If all checks pass, the representation invariant holds
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

The `repOK` method checks the following conditions to ensure the representation invariant of the LinkedList class holds:

1.  The list is not empty, and the header node is the only node in the list.
2.  The header node is the first and last element in the list.
3.  All nodes in the list are linked correctly, with each node's `next` field pointing to the next node in the list.
4.  The last node in the list is linked to the header node.
5.  The list does not contain any null elements.

If any of these conditions are not met, the `repOK` method returns `false`, indicating that the representation invariant does not hold. Otherwise, it returns `true`.
