Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class in Java. The invariant should be a method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I'll look at the structure of the HashMap class. It has several instance variables: table (an array of Entry objects), size, threshold, loadFactor, modCount. 

The representation invariant should check that all these variables are consistent and in a valid state. 

Let me think about each variable:

1. The table array should not be null. So, table != null must be true.

2. The size should be non-negative because you can't have a negative number of elements in a map. So, size >= 0.

3. The threshold should be less than or equal to the capacity of the table. Because threshold is the point at which the table will be resized. So, threshold <= table.length.

4. The loadFactor should be a positive number. Since it's a float, it should be greater than 0.

5. The modCount should be non-negative as it's used to track concurrent modifications. So, modCount >= 0.

6. Each bucket in the table (each Entry) should form a valid linked list. That means for every Entry in the table, its next pointer should either point to another Entry or be null. So, for all entries in the table, if the entry is not null, then its next should be an Entry or null.

7. The size should be less than or equal to the threshold. Because the threshold is the maximum number of elements before resizing. So, size <= threshold.

8. The table's length should be a power of two. Because in the constructor, the initial capacity is rounded up to the nearest power of two. So, table.length should be a power of two. How to check that? Well, in Java, a number is a power of two if it's greater than zero and (table.length & (table.length - 1)) == 0.

Wait, but in the constructor, the initial capacity is set by shifting left until it's greater than initialCapacity. So, the table's length is always a power of two. So, the invariant should check that table.length is a power of two.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should check all these conditions. If any of them fail, it returns false; otherwise, true.

So, the method will have a series of if statements checking each condition. If any condition is violated, it returns false. If all are satisfied, it returns true.

I should also make sure that the method is public and has no side effects. It's a boolean method, so it should just perform the checks.

Let me outline the checks:

- Check table is not null.
- Check size is >= 0.
- Check threshold <= table.length.
- Check loadFactor > 0.
- Check modCount >= 0.
- Check each entry's next is valid.
- Check size <= threshold.
- Check table.length is a power of two.

Wait, but checking each entry's next could be time-consuming, especially for large tables. However, for the sake of the invariant, it's necessary to ensure the data structure's integrity.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant doesn't need to check every single entry's next pointer because that could be too slow. But according to the rules, I should only verify properties I'm completely sure are valid. So, if I'm certain that the linked lists are always correctly formed, then I can include that check. Otherwise, maybe it's better to exclude it to avoid performance issues.

Hmm, but in the given code, the addEntry and transfer methods manage the next pointers correctly, so perhaps it's safe to include that check.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant doesn't need to check every entry's next, but just that the overall structure is consistent. But for the sake of thoroughness, I'll include it.

Wait, but in the given code, the Entry class's next pointer is only set when adding new entries, and during transfer in resize. So, it's possible that the next pointers are always correctly set. So, including the check might be okay.

But in practice, for a production code, such a check could be too slow. However, since this is an invariant, it's meant to be a correctness check, not a performance check. So, it's better to include it.

So, the method will loop through each bucket in the table. For each non-null entry, it will check that the next pointer is either null or another Entry.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will have all these checks.

Now, let me write the code.

First, check table != null.

Then, check size >=0.

Then, check threshold <= table.length.

Check loadFactor > 0.

Check modCount >=0.

Then, for each entry in table:

for (Entry e : table) {
    if (e != null) {
        if (e.next == null) continue;
        if (!(e.next instanceof Entry)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

Wait, but in Java, e.next is of type Entry, so perhaps the instanceof check is redundant. But perhaps it's better to ensure that e.next is either null or an Entry.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can just check that e.next is null or not. But since the Entry's next is always another Entry or null, perhaps the check is unnecessary. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the check is not needed because the Entry's next is always properly set. But to be thorough, perhaps it's better to include it.

Wait, but in the given code, the Entry's next is only set when adding new entries, and during transfer. So, perhaps the next pointers are always correctly set. So, maybe the check is redundant. But to be safe, perhaps it's better to include it.

Alternatively, perhaps the check is not necessary because the Entry's next is always properly managed. So, perhaps it's better to exclude it to avoid unnecessary computation.

Hmm, perhaps the main checks are the ones about table not being null, size >=0, threshold <= table.length, loadFactor >0, modCount >=0, size <= threshold, and table.length is a power of two.

So, perhaps the check about the next pointers can be omitted for performance reasons, as it's not necessary for the invariant's correctness.

So, the method will have the following checks:

if (table == null) return false;
if (size < 0) return false;
if (threshold < 0 || threshold > table.length) return false;
if (loadFactor <= 0) return false;
if (modCount < 0) return false;
if (size > threshold) return false;
if ((table.length & (table.length -1)) != 0) return false;

Wait, but the threshold can be equal to table.length? Because when the table is full, the threshold is equal to table.length. So, the condition should be threshold <= table.length.

Wait, in the constructor, threshold is set to (int)(capacity * loadFactor). So, if the load factor is 0.75, and capacity is 16, threshold is 12. So, size can be up to 12 before resizing.

Wait, but in the addEntry method, if size >= threshold, it resizes. So, the size can be equal to threshold, but not exceed it.

So, the condition should be size <= threshold.

So, in the invariant, if size > threshold, return false.

Also, the table's length must be a power of two. So, (table.length & (table.length -1)) == 0.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will have these checks.

So, the code would look like:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) return false;
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (threshold < 0 || threshold > table.length) return false;
    if (loadFactor <= 0) return false;
    if (modCount < 0) return false;
    if (size > threshold) return false;
    if ((table.length & (table.length -1)) != 0) return false;
    return true;
}

Wait, but in the code, the threshold can be set to Integer.MAX_VALUE in the resize method when the capacity is maximum. So, in that case, threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE, which is larger than table.length. But in that case, the condition threshold <= table.length would fail. So, perhaps the condition should be threshold <= table.length || threshold == Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Wait, looking at the resize method:

if (oldCapacity == MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) {
    threshold = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    return;
}

So, when the table is at maximum capacity, threshold is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE, which is larger than the table's length (which is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, which is 1 << 30, which is 1073741824, while Integer.MAX_VALUE is 2147483647). So, in that case, threshold is larger than table.length.

So, the condition threshold <= table.length would fail, but it's actually a valid state.

So, the invariant should account for that.

So, the condition should be:

if (threshold < 0 || (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE)) return false;

Wait, but how can we check that? Because when threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE, it's allowed even if it's larger than table.length.

So, the condition should be:

if (threshold < 0 || (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
    return false;
}

Alternatively, perhaps the condition can be written as:

if (threshold < 0 || (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
    return false;
}

But that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition can be split into two parts:

if (threshold < 0) return false;
if (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return false;

So, in code:

if (threshold < 0) return false;
if (threshold > table.length) {
    if (threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
        return false;
    }
}

So, that would allow threshold to be Integer.MAX_VALUE even if it's larger than table.length.

So, incorporating that into the repOK method.

Another point: the modCount is volatile, but in the invariant, we just check that it's non-negative, which is correct.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will have the following checks:

- table is not null.
- size is >=0.
- threshold is >=0.
- threshold is <= table.length or threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
- loadFactor is >0.
- modCount >=0.
- size <= threshold.
- table.length is a power of two.

So, the code would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) return false;
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (threshold < 0) return false;
    if (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return false;
    if (loadFactor <= 0) return false;
    if (modCount < 0) return false;
    if (size > threshold) return false;
    if ((table.length & (table.length -1)) != 0) return false;
    return true;
}

Wait, but in the case where threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE, we need to ensure that the table's length is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, because in the resize method, when oldCapacity is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, it sets threshold to Integer.MAX_VALUE and returns without resizing.

So, perhaps the condition should also check that if threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE, then table.length must be MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

Because, in the resize method, when the old capacity is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, it doesn't resize, so the table remains at MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, and threshold is set to Integer.MAX_VALUE.

So, in the invariant, if threshold is Integer.MAX_VALUE, then table.length must be MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

So, adding that condition:

if (threshold == Integer.MAX_VALUE && table.length != MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) return false;

So, updating the code:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) return false;
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (threshold < 0) return false;
    if (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return false;
    if (threshold == Integer.MAX_VALUE && table.length != MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) return false;
    if (loadFactor <= 0) return false;
    if (modCount < 0) return false;
    if (size > threshold) return false;
    if ((table.length & (table.length -1)) != 0) return false;
    return true;
}

That should cover all cases.

Another point: the Entry's hash should be consistent with the key. But that's part of the Entry's own invariant, not the HashMap's. So, perhaps the HashMap's repOK doesn't need to check that.

So, the final repOK method includes all these checks.
</think>

To ensure the HashMap object is in a valid state, the `repOK` method checks several invariants:

1. The table array is not null.
2. The size is non-negative.
3. The threshold is non-negative and either less than or equal to the table length or set to Integer.MAX_VALUE only if the table length is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.
4. The load factor is positive.
5. The modCount is non-negative.
6. The size does not exceed the threshold.
7. The table length is a power of two.

Here is the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) return false;
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (threshold < 0) return false;
    if (threshold > table.length && threshold != Integer.MAX_VALUE) return false;
    if (threshold == Integer.MAX_VALUE && table.length != MAXIMUM_CAPACITY) return false;
    if (loadFactor <= 0) return false;
    if (modCount < 0) return false;
    if (size > threshold) return false;
    if ((table.length & (table.length - 1)) != 0) return false;
    return true;
}
```
