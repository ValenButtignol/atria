Alright, I'm trying to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. I'm not entirely sure what a representation invariant is, but from what I remember, it's a condition that must always hold true for the object to be considered valid. So, I need to think about what makes a binary tree valid in this context.

First, I'll look at the BinTree class. It has a private field root, which is of type Node, and a size variable. The add method adds nodes to the tree, and there's an addRecursive helper method. The Node class has left, right, and info fields.

So, the basic things I need to ensure are:
1. The root should be null if the tree is empty.
2. The size should accurately reflect the number of nodes in the tree.
3. Each node should have valid left and right children, meaning they shouldn't point to null if they're supposed to have children.
4. The tree should maintain its structure, meaning each node's left child should have a smaller value than the node, and the right child should have a larger value. Wait, is that the case here? Looking back at the addRecursive method, it seems like it's adding nodes in a way that maintains a binary search tree (BST) property. So, I should include that in the invariant.

Let me think about each of these points:

1. **Root and Size Relationship**: If the tree is empty, root should be null, and size should be 0. If root is not null, size should be at least 1. Also, adding a node should increment size by 1.

2. **BST Property**: For every node, all nodes in its left subtree should have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree should have values greater than the node's value. This is crucial for the tree's structure and operations like search, insert, and delete.

3. **Children Validity**: Each node should have valid left and right children. If a node is supposed to have a left child (i.e., its left is not null), then that child should be a Node object, not null. Similarly for the right child.

4. **No Duplicates**: Since the add method checks if x equals current.info and returns without adding, it implies that duplicates are not allowed. So, each node's info should be unique.

Now, how do I translate these into a Java method called repOK? It should return true if the tree is valid and false otherwise.

Let's outline the checks:

- If root is not null and size is not equal to the number of nodes in the tree, it's invalid.
- If root is null and size is not zero, invalid.
- For each node, check that if it has a left child, it's not null, and that the left child's info is less than the node's info.
- Similarly, check the right child's info is greater than the node's info.
- Ensure that there are no duplicates, meaning each node's info is unique.

Wait, how do I check that the size matches the number of nodes? I can traverse the tree and count the nodes, then compare with the size variable.

Also, I need to make sure that the BST property holds for every node. So, I'll have to write a helper method that recursively checks each node.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform several checks:

1. Check if root is null and size is zero.
2. Check if root is not null and size matches the count of nodes.
3. Check that each node's left and right children are valid and satisfy the BST property.
4. Ensure there are no duplicates.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll try to write the code for repOK based on these checks.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if root is null and size is zero
    if (root == null && size != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if root is not null and size matches the number of nodes
    if (root != null && size != getNodeCount()) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if each node satisfies the BST property
    if (!isBST()) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if there are no duplicates
    if (!hasUniqueValues()) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

private int getNodeCount() {
    int count = 0;
    Node current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        count++;
        current = current.right;
    }
    return count;
}

private boolean isBST() {
    return isBSTHelper(root, null, null);
}

private boolean isBSTHelper(Node node, Node left, Node right) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (left != null && node.info <= left.info) {
        return false;
    }
    if (right != null && node.info >= right.info) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBSTHelper(node.left, left, node) && isBSTHelper(node.right, node, right);
}

private boolean hasUniqueValues() {
    Set<Integer> values = new HashSet<>();
    return isUniqueHelper(root, values);
}

private boolean isUniqueHelper(Node node, Set<Integer> values) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (values.contains(node.info)) {
        return false;
    }
    values.add(node.info);
    return isUniqueHelper(node.left, values) && isUniqueHelper(node.right, values);
}
```
