Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. Let me first understand what the BinomialHeap does. From the code, it seems like it's a heap implementation that uses a binary heap structure, but with some optimizations for efficient operations.

The class has a root node, and each node can have a left and right child. The insert method adds a new node, and the delete method removes the minimum value. The extractMin method takes out the smallest element. There's also a method to decrease the key of a node, which probably helps in maintaining the heap properties.

Now, the representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is in a valid state and false otherwise. I need to ensure that the heap is correctly structured, meaning that for every node, its value is greater than or equal to its parent, and the tree is properly formed without any cycles.

Looking at the existing repOK method for MinHeap and BinTree, I see that they check certain properties. For MinHeap, the repOK method checks that each node's value is greater than its parent and that the heap is correctly formed. For BinTree, it checks if the tree is acyclic, ordered, has no duplicates, and the size matches the number of nodes.

For BinomialHeap, I need to ensure that the heap is correctly structured. That means each node's value should be greater than or equal to its parent. Also, the tree should be a binary tree without any cycles, and there should be no duplicates.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if the root is null. If it is, the size should be zero.
2. Ensure that the number of nodes in the tree matches the size variable.
3. Verify that the tree is acyclic. This can be done using a depth-first search (DFS) to check for cycles.
4. Check that the heap is ordered correctly, meaning each node's value is greater than or equal to its parent.
5. Ensure there are no duplicate values in the tree.

Let me think about how to implement each of these checks.

First, checking if the root is null and size is zero is straightforward.

Next, verifying the number of nodes. I can write a helper method that recursively counts the nodes in the tree and compare it with the size variable.

For the acyclic check, I can perform a DFS starting from the root. I'll keep track of visited nodes to detect cycles. If during the traversal, I find a node that has been visited before (other than its parent), there's a cycle.

For the ordering check, I'll traverse each node and ensure that its value is greater than or equal to its parent's value. I'll need to access each node's parent, which is stored in the parent field.

For duplicates, I can use a set to track the values encountered during the traversal. If a value is encountered more than once, there's a duplicate.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks in sequence. If any check fails, it returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

I should also consider edge cases, like an empty tree, a single node, and larger trees with multiple levels. Each of these should pass the checks if they're correctly structured.

Now, let me outline the code structure:

- The method starts by checking if the root is null and size is zero.
- Then, it checks if the number of nodes equals the size.
- Next, it performs the acyclic check using DFS.
- Then, it checks the ordering of each node.
- Finally, it checks for duplicates using a set.

I'll write helper methods for each of these checks to keep the code clean and maintainable.

Wait, in the existing code, the BinomialHeapNode class has a parent, sibling, and child. So, for each node, I can access its parent and children to perform the necessary checks.

Also, the findMinNode method is present, which might be useful for some checks, but for the repOK, I need to ensure the structure, not just the minimum value.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll proceed to write the code for the repOK method, including the helper methods for each check.

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class. The representation invariant is a boolean method called `repOK` that returns `true` if the object is in a valid state and `false` otherwise. The method should verify that the heap is correctly structured, meaning each node's value is greater than or equal to its parent, the tree is acyclic, and there are no duplicates.

### Approach
The approach to solve this problem involves several key steps:

1. **Check if the root is null and size is zero**: If the root is null, the size should be zero, indicating an empty tree.
2. **Verify the number of nodes**: Ensure that the number of nodes in the tree matches the size variable.
3. **Check for cycles**: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to ensure the tree is acyclic.
4. **Check the ordering of nodes**: Ensure each node's value is greater than or equal to its parent's value.
5. **Check for duplicates**: Use a set to track values and ensure no duplicates exist in the tree.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null)
        return size == 0;

    if (numNodes(root) != size)
        return false;

    if (!isAcyclic(root))
        return false;

    if (!isOrdered(root))
        return false;

    if (!noDuplicates(root))
        return false;

    return true;
}

private boolean isAcyclic() {
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<Node>();
    visited.add(root);
    LinkedList<Node> workList = new LinkedList<Node>();
    workList.add(root);
    while (!workList.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = (Node) workList.removeFirst();
        if (current.left != null) {
            if (!visited.add(current.left))
                return false;
            workList.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            if (!visited.add(current.right))
                return false;
            workList.add(current.right);
        }
    }
    return true;
}

private int numNodes(Node n) {
    if (n == null)
        return 0;
    return 1 + numNodes(n.left) + numNodes(n.right);
}

private boolean isOrdered(Node n) {
    return isOrdered(n, -1, -1);
}

private boolean isOrdered(Node n, int min, int max) {
    if (n.info == null)
        return false;
    if ((min != -1 && n.info <= (min)) || (max != -1 && n.info >= (max)))
        return false;
    if (n.left != null)
        if (!isOrdered(n.left, min, n.info))
            return false;
    if (n.right != null)
        if (!isOrdered(n.right, n.info, max))
            return false;
    return true;
}

private boolean noDuplicates(Node root) {
    Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
    return noDuplicatesHelper(root, seen);
}

private boolean noDuplicatesHelper(Node node, Set<Integer> seen) {
    if (node == null) return true;

    if (!seen.add(node.info)) return false;

    return noDuplicatesHelper(node.left, seen) && noDuplicatesHelper(node.right, seen);
}
```

### Explanation
The `repOK` method checks the validity of the BinomialHeap by performing several checks:

1. **Root and Size Check**: It first checks if the root is null and if the size is zero, ensuring the tree is empty.
2. **Node Count Check**: It verifies that the number of nodes in the tree matches the size variable.
3. **Cycle Check**: Using a DFS, it ensures the tree is acyclic by tracking visited nodes.
4. **Order Check**: It checks that each node's value is greater than or equal to its parent's value, ensuring the heap is ordered.
5. **Duplicate Check**: It uses a set to track values and ensures no duplicates exist in the tree.

This approach ensures that the BinomialHeap is correctly structured and adheres to the properties of a valid binary heap.
