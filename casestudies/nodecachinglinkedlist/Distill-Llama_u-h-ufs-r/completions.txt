Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me first understand what this class does. 

From the code, I see that it's a linked list implementation with a caching mechanism. The idea is that when a node is added, if the cache isn't full, it's added to the cache. If the cache is full, the least recently used node is evicted. When a node is removed, it's added back to the cache. 

So, the key properties to check are:

1. **Cache Size**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size. Also, when nodes are added or removed, the cache size should be correctly updated.

2. **No Duplicates in Cache**: Each node in the cache should have a unique value. If a node is already in the cache, adding it again should either update its value or not add it if it's a duplicate.

3. **Structure of the Linked List**: The linked list should be properly linked. Each node should have correct previous and next pointers, especially after adding and removing nodes.

4. **Correct Cache Eviction**: When adding a new node, if the cache is full, the least recently used node (the first in the cache) should be evicted.

Let me think about how to check these in the repOK method.

First, I'll check if the cache size is within the allowed maximum. If the cache is full, it shouldn't exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, when nodes are added or removed, the cache size should reflect those changes.

Next, I need to ensure that the cache doesn't have duplicate values. Each node in the cache should have a unique value. So, I'll iterate through the cache and check for duplicates.

Then, I'll verify the structure of the linked list. For each node, I'll check that the previous and next pointers are correctly set. Also, I'll ensure that the header node is correctly linked.

Additionally, I'll check that when a node is added to the cache, it's correctly linked into the cache sequence. The firstCachedNode should point to the next node, and so on.

I should also ensure that when a node is removed from the cache, it's properly detached from the linked list and that the size is updated correctly.

Wait, but how do I check the linked list structure? I can iterate through each node and verify their previous and next pointers. For the header, its next should be the first node, and its previous should be null. Each node in the cache should have their next and previous pointers correctly set.

Also, when a node is added to the cache, it's inserted before the firstCachedNode. So, I need to make sure that the insertion is done correctly, maintaining the linked list structure.

Another thing to check is that when a node is evicted from the cache, it's correctly removed from the linked list and its previous and next pointers are updated.

Hmm, but in the repOK method, I can't modify the structure, just check it. So, I'll have to verify all these properties by reading the fields and possibly traversing the linked list.

Let me outline the steps for the repOK method:

1. **Check Cache Size**: Ensure that cacheSize is not negative and does not exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, ensure that the size of the linked list is correct.

2. **Check Cache Structure**: Verify that the cache is a proper doubly linked list. The header's next should be the first node, and the last node's next should be null. Each node in the cache should have a unique value.

3. **Check Linked List Structure**: Ensure that all nodes in the linked list have correct previous and next pointers. The header's previous should be null, and the last node's next should be null.

4. **Check Cache Eviction and Addition**: When adding a node to the cache, if the cache is full, the first node should be evicted, and the new node should be added correctly. When removing a node, it should be added back to the cache.

Wait, but the repOK method can't perform any operations, only read the state. So, I need to check that all the invariants are satisfied by reading the fields.

Let me think about each condition:

- **Cache Size**: The cacheSize should be between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive. Also, the size of the linked list (size field) should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the non-cached nodes.

Wait, no. The size field in the NodeCachingLinkedList represents the total number of nodes in the linked list. The cacheSize is the number of nodes in the cache. So, the size should be equal to cacheSize plus the number of non-cached nodes. But that's complicated to check. Alternatively, I can check that the size is consistent with the cache and the linked list structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the cache size is within bounds and that the linked list's structure is correct.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, check that the cache size is valid:

if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) return false;

Then, check that the cache is a valid doubly linked list:

- header.next should be the first node in the cache.
- The last node in the cache should have next as null.
- Each node in the cache should have a unique value.

Wait, but how do I find the last node in the cache? I can traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode and go to the end.

Alternatively, I can traverse the cache and ensure that each node's next is correctly set.

Also, I need to ensure that the cache doesn't have duplicate values. So, I can collect all the values in the cache and check for duplicates.

Another point: when a node is added to the cache, it's inserted before the firstCachedNode. So, the cache should form a sequence where each node's next is the next node in the cache, and the last node's next is null.

So, in the repOK method:

- Check that the cache is a valid doubly linked list.
- Check that all values in the cache are unique.
- Check that the cache size is within the allowed maximum.
- Check that the linked list structure outside the cache is correct.

Wait, but the linked list includes both the cache and the non-cached nodes. So, I need to ensure that the entire linked list is properly linked, including the non-cached nodes.

This might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can focus on the cache's invariants and the linked list's structure, ensuring that the cache is correctly maintained and that the linked list is properly formed.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will:

1. Check that the cache size is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.

2. Check that the cache is a valid doubly linked list:
   - header.next is the first node in the cache.
   - The last node in the cache has next as null.
   - Each node in the cache has a unique value.

3. Check that the linked list structure outside the cache is correct:
   - The header's previous is null.
   - The last node's next is null.
   - All nodes have correct previous and next pointers.

Wait, but the header is part of the linked list, and the cache is a subset of it. So, the header's next should point to the first node in the cache, and the last node in the cache should have next as null.

Additionally, the cache should not have any duplicates in values.

So, the steps in code would be:

- Check cache size is valid.

- If the cache is not empty, check that the firstCachedNode is not null and that it's correctly linked.

- Traverse the cache to ensure each node's next is correctly set and that the last node's next is null.

- Collect all values in the cache and ensure they are unique.

- Check that the header's next is the first node in the cache and that the header's previous is null.

- Check that the last node in the cache has next as null.

- Also, ensure that the entire linked list is properly linked, including nodes outside the cache.

Wait, but the entire linked list's structure is managed by the add and remove operations. So, perhaps the repOK method should also check that the linked list is properly formed, including the non-cached nodes.

But that might be too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can focus on the cache's invariants and the linked list's structure related to the cache.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that:

- The cache is a valid sequence, with each node having correct next and previous pointers.

- The cache's values are unique.

- The cache size is within the allowed maximum.

- The linked list's header and the cache are correctly linked.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the cache is empty
    if (cacheSize == 0) {
        // Check that the header's next is null
        if (header.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Check that the first node in the cache is correctly linked
    LinkedListNode firstCacheNode = firstCachedNode;
    if (firstCacheNode == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the last node in the cache has next as null
    LinkedListNode lastCacheNode = firstCacheNode;
    while (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        lastCacheNode = lastCacheNode.next;
    }
    if (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the header's next is the first node
    if (header.next != firstCacheNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the header's previous is null
    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that all values in the cache are unique
    Set<Object> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    for (LinkedListNode node = firstCacheNode; node != null; node = node.next) {
        Object value = node.getValue();
        if (value == null) {
            return false; // Null values are not allowed?
        }
        if (seenValues.contains(value)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenValues.add(value);
    }

    // Check that the cache is correctly linked
    LinkedListNode current = firstCacheNode;
    while (current != null) {
        // Check previous and next pointers
        if (current.previous != null && current.previous.next != current) {
            return false;
        }
        if (current.next != null && current.next.previous != current) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check that the linked list outside the cache is correctly formed
    // This is more complex, but perhaps we can check that the header's previous is null and the last node's next is null.
    // Alternatively, we can check that the entire linked list is properly linked, but that's time-consuming.

    // For simplicity, we'll check that the header's previous is null and the last node's next is null.
    // But this might not cover all cases.

    // Check that the last node in the entire linked list has next as null
    LinkedListNode lastNode = header;
    while (lastNode.next != null) {
        lastNode = lastNode.next;
    }
    if (lastNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, if the linked list has nodes outside the cache that are not properly linked, the repOK method might not catch it. However, given the complexity, perhaps it's acceptable to focus on the cache's invariants and the linked list structure related to the cache.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can check that the entire linked list is properly linked, including the non-cached nodes. But that would require traversing the entire list, which could be time-consuming.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with checking the cache's invariants and the linked list structure related to the cache, as well as ensuring that the entire linked list is properly linked.

So, in the repOK method, I'll:

1. Check that the cache size is valid.

2. If the cache is not empty, check that the first and last nodes in the cache are correctly linked.

3. Check that all values in the cache are unique.

4. Check that the cache is a valid doubly linked list.

5. Check that the entire linked list is properly linked, meaning the header's previous is null and the last node's next is null.

Putting this into code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // If cache is empty, check header
    if (cacheSize == 0) {
        if (header.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Check first node in cache
    LinkedListNode firstCacheNode = firstCachedNode;
    if (firstCacheNode == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check last node in cache
    LinkedListNode lastCacheNode = firstCacheNode;
    while (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        lastCacheNode = lastCacheNode.next;
    }
    if (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check header's next is firstCacheNode
    if (header.next != firstCacheNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check header's previous is null
    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all values in cache are unique
    Set<Object> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    for (LinkedListNode node = firstCacheNode; node != null; node = node.next) {
        Object value = node.getValue();
        if (value == null) {
            return false; // Assuming null values are not allowed
        }
        if (seenValues.contains(value)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenValues.add(value);
    }

    // Check cache is a valid doubly linked list
    LinkedListNode current = firstCacheNode;
    while (current != null) {
        // Check previous
        if (current.previous != null && current.previous.next != current) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check next
        if (current.next != null && current.next.previous != current) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check entire linked list is properly linked
    // Header's previous is null
    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Last node's next is null
    LinkedListNode lastNode = header;
    while (lastNode.next != null) {
        lastNode = lastNode.next;
    }
    if (lastNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

This should cover the main invariants: cache size, uniqueness, linked list structure for the cache, and the overall linked list structure.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class. The goal is to ensure that the class adheres to specific invariants, such as correct cache size, unique values in the cache, and proper linked list structure.

### Approach
The `NodeCachingLinkedList` class manages a linked list with a cache. The cache has a limited size, and nodes can be added to the cache. If the cache is full, the least recently used node is evicted. When a node is removed, it is added back to the cache. The key invariants to check are:

1. **Cache Size**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size and should be non-negative.
2. **Unique Values in Cache**: Each value in the cache should be unique.
3. **Linked List Structure**: The cache should form a valid doubly linked list, and the entire linked list should be properly structured.

The approach involves:
1. Checking the cache size is within valid bounds.
2. Verifying that the cache forms a valid doubly linked list.
3. Ensuring all values in the cache are unique.
4. Checking the overall structure of the linked list, including the header and the last node.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size is within valid range
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // If cache is empty, check that header's next is null
    if (cacheSize == 0) {
        if (header.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Check first node in cache
    LinkedListNode firstCacheNode = firstCachedNode;
    if (firstCacheNode == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check last node in cache
    LinkedListNode lastCacheNode = firstCacheNode;
    while (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        lastCacheNode = lastCacheNode.next;
    }
    if (lastCacheNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check header's next is firstCacheNode
    if (header.next != firstCacheNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check header's previous is null
    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all values in cache are unique
    Set<Object> seenValues = new HashSet<>();
    for (LinkedListNode node = firstCacheNode; node != null; node = node.next) {
        Object value = node.getValue();
        if (value == null) {
            return false; // Assuming null values are not allowed
        }
        if (seenValues.contains(value)) {
            return false;
        }
        seenValues.add(value);
    }

    // Check cache is a valid doubly linked list
    LinkedListNode current = firstCacheNode;
    while (current != null) {
        // Check previous
        if (current.previous != null && current.previous.next != current) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check next
        if (current.next != null && current.next.previous != current) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check entire linked list is properly linked
    // Header's previous is null
    if (header.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Last node's next is null
    LinkedListNode lastNode = header;
    while (lastNode.next != null) {
        lastNode = lastNode.next;
    }
    if (lastNode.next != null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation
The `repOK` method checks several key aspects of the `NodeCachingLinkedList`:

1. **Cache
