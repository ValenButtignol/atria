Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me think about what this class does. From the code, I see that it's a linked list with a cache mechanism. When adding a new node, if the cache is full, it adds the new node to the cache, replacing the oldest one. If the cache isn't full, it just adds it to the end.

So, the representation invariant should ensure that the data structure behaves correctly according to its design. Let me consider the key properties:

1. **Cache Management**: The cache should never exceed its maximum size. So, the cacheSize should never be greater than maximumCacheSize.

2. **Cache Filling**: When the cache is full, adding a new node should evict the oldest node in the cache. This means that the first node in the cache (firstCachedNode) should be the one to be replaced.

3. **Node Structure**: Each node in the linked list should have proper linksâ€”previous and next pointers. Also, when a node is added to the cache, it should be correctly linked in the linked list.

4. **Consistency**: The linked list should maintain its structure. For example, when a node is removed, it should be properly detached and added to the cache if there's space.

Let me break down each of these points.

First, the cache size must not exceed the maximum. So, in the repOK method, I should check that cacheSize is less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.

Next, when the cache is full, adding a new node should evict the oldest node. This means that the first node in the cache (firstCachedNode) should be the one removed. So, if the cache is full and we add a new node, the first node should be updated to the next node, and its previous node's next pointer should point to null.

Then, the linked list structure must be maintained. Each node should have a correct previous and next pointer. When a node is removed from the linked list, it should be properly detached, meaning its previous node's next pointer should be updated, and its next node's previous pointer should also be updated. Additionally, when a node is added to the cache, it should be added to the end of the linked list, and its previous node should point to the current last node.

Another important point is that when a node is removed from the linked list, it should be added to the cache if there's space. This ensures that the cache doesn't grow beyond its maximum size.

I should also consider edge cases, like when the linked list is empty or when the cache is empty. For example, if the linked list is empty, the first node should be null. If the cache is empty, adding a node should just add it to the end of the linked list and to the cache.

Putting this all together, the repOK method should check:

- Cache size is within bounds.
- When the cache is full, adding a new node correctly evicts the oldest node.
- The linked list maintains correct pointers.
- Nodes are properly added to the cache when there's space.
- Edge cases like empty linked list and empty cache are handled.

I think I've covered the main points. Now, I'll structure these thoughts into the repOK method.

To ensure the NodeCachingLinkedList class maintains its intended behavior, the representation invariant must verify several key properties:

1. **Cache Size Constraint**: The cache size must not exceed the maximum cache size.
2. **Cache Eviction**: When the cache is full, adding a new node should evict the oldest node.
3. **Linked List Structure**: Nodes must have correct previous and next pointers.
4. **Cache Addition**: Nodes added to the cache should be appended to the linked list.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle scenarios where the linked list or cache is empty.

Here's the representation invariant implemented as a method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size does not exceed maximum
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the linked list is empty
    if (header.next == header) {
        // Check if cache is also empty
        if (cacheSize == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        // If linked list is empty but cache is not, return false
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the first node in the cache is the oldest in the linked list
    LinkedListNode firstInList = header.next;
    LinkedListNode firstCachedNode = firstCachedNode;
    if (firstCachedNode != null && firstCachedNode != firstInList) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the oldest node in the cache is correctly evicted when cache is full
    if (cacheSize == maximumCacheSize) {
        // Evict the oldest node
        LinkedListNode oldestNode = firstCachedNode;
        firstCachedNode = firstCachedNode.next;
        if (oldestNode != null) {
            // Detach the oldest node from the linked list
            LinkedListNode nextNode = oldestNode.next;
            nextNode.previous = null;
            // Add the oldest node to the cache if it's not already there
            if (!isNodeInCache(oldestNode)) {
                addNodeToCache(oldestNode);
            }
        }
    }

    // Ensure all nodes in the cache are present in the linked list
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current == firstCachedNode) {
            firstCachedNode = current.next;
        }
        if (!isNodeInCache(current)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Ensure no node is added to the cache more than once
    return true;
}

private boolean isNodeInCache(LinkedListNode node) {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (node == current) {
            return true;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    return false;
}
```

This method checks that the linked list and cache are consistent, ensuring nodes are correctly evicted and maintained within size constraints.
