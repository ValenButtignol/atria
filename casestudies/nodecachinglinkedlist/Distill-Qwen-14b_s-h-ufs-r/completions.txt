Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should check all the invariants that ensure the object is valid. Let me think about what properties must hold.

First, the linked list structure. Each node should have previous and next pointers that form a cycle. The header node is a sentinel, so its previous should point to itself, and next should point to the first node. For all other nodes, previous and next should not point to null, except maybe when the list is empty.

Wait, the header's next is the first node, and the last node's next should point back to the header. So for any node except the header, their previous and next should form a cycle. Also, the size should be consistent with the number of nodes in the list.

Another thing: the cache management. The cacheSize should not exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, the firstCachedNode should only point to nodes that are in the cache, which are nodes that have their value set to null. Because when a node is cached, its value is set to null, and it's stored in the cache for reuse.

So, I need to check that the cacheSize is within bounds. Also, the firstCachedNode should be null if cacheSize is zero. And each cached node's value should be null.

Let me outline the checks:

1. Check the linked list structure:
   - The header's previous is itself, and next points to the first node.
   - For each node except the header, previous and next are not null.
   - The size is correct, i.e., the number of nodes in the list equals the size variable.

2. Check the cache:
   - cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
   - If cacheSize > 0, firstCachedNode is not null.
   - Each node in the cache (starting from firstCachedNode) has a value of null.
   - The next of the last cached node points to null, and the count is correct.

3. Check for consistency between header, size, and the actual nodes.

Let me think about how to implement these checks.

For the linked list structure:
- Start from the header and traverse next until we come back to header. Count the nodes to ensure the size is correct.
- Ensure that each node's previous and next are correctly set, forming a cycle.

For the cache:
- Check that cacheSize is <= maximumCacheSize and >=0.
- If cacheSize >0, firstCachedNode should not be null.
- Traverse the cached nodes starting from firstCachedNode, check each has value null, and count them to ensure cacheSize is correct.

Wait, but the cache is a linked list of nodes that are no longer in the main list. So each cached node's next should point to the next cached node, and their previous should be set to null, perhaps? Or maybe not, since when they are in the cache, their previous and next are not part of the main list.

Alternatively, when a node is added to the cache, its previous and next are set to null, and it's linked into the cache's linked list. So the firstCachedNode is the head of the cache list, and each node in the cache has next pointing to the next cached node, and previous pointing to the previous one, except the first which has previous null.

Wait, looking at the code:

In addNodeToCache, the node's previous is set to null, next is set to nextCachedNode. So the cached nodes form a separate linked list, where each node's previous is the previous in the cache, except the first which has previous null.

So to check the cache:
- The number of nodes in the cache (traversing from firstCachedNode) should equal cacheSize.
- Each node in the cache has value null.
- The firstCachedNode's previous is null.
- Each subsequent node's previous points to the previous node in the cache.

Also, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache, but only if the cache is not full.

Another point: the header's next should be the first node in the list, and the last node's next should be the header.

Let me structure the repOK method:

1. Check if the header's previous is itself and next is either another node or itself (if the list is empty).
2. Traverse the main list from header.next to header, counting nodes to ensure size is correct.
3. For each node in the main list, check that previous and next are not null (except header).
4. Check that the cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
5. If cacheSize >0, firstCachedNode should not be null.
6. Traverse the cache from firstCachedNode, count the nodes, ensure each has value null, and their previous and next form a proper linked list.
7. Ensure that the sum of the main list size and cacheSize does not exceed the maximumCacheSize plus the initial size? Or perhaps that the cache only holds nodes that have been removed.

Wait, maybe not. The cache can hold up to maximumCacheSize nodes, regardless of the main list's size.

Another thing: when a node is removed, it's added to the cache if the cache isn't full. So the cache can have up to maximumCacheSize nodes.

So in repOK, I need to:

- Verify the main list structure.
- Verify the cache structure.
- Ensure that the size of the main list plus the cacheSize does not exceed the maximum possible, but perhaps that's not necessary since the code enforces it.

Let me outline the steps in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.getPrevious() != header || header.getNext() == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main list
    int mainSize = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.getNext();
    while (current != header) {
        mainSize++;
        // Check that current is properly linked
        if (current.getPrevious() == null || current.getNext() == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.getNext();
    }
    if (mainSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cacheSize > 0 && firstCachedNode == null) {
        return false;
    }
    int cachedNodes = 0;
    LinkedListNode cacheCurrent = firstCachedNode;
    while (cacheCurrent != null) {
        cachedNodes++;
        if (cacheCurrent.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check previous and next in cache
        if (cacheCurrent.getPrevious() != null && cacheCurrent.getPrevious() != cacheCurrent) {
            return false;
        }
        if (cacheCurrent.getNext() == null) {
            break; // end of cache
        }
        cacheCurrent = cacheCurrent.getNext();
    }
    if (cachedNodes != cacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Additional checks
    // Ensure that the header's next is the first node, and the last node's next is header
    current = header.getNext();
    if (current == header) {
        // list is empty
    } else {
        while (current.getNext() != header) {
            current = current.getNext();
        }
        // Now current is last node
        if (current.getNext() != header) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the main list traversal, I already checked that each node's next is not null, except the last which points back to header. So perhaps that's redundant.

Another point: when the list is empty, header.next should point to itself.

Wait, in the constructor, header is initialized as new LinkedListNode(), which sets next and previous to itself. So when the list is empty, header.next is header.

So in the main list check, if header.next is header, then mainSize remains 0, which should equal size (which is 0). So that's handled.

Another thing: in the cache, each node's previous should point to the previous node in the cache, except the first which should have previous null. Also, the next of the last cached node should be null.

Wait, in the code, when adding to the cache, the node's previous is set to null, and next is set to nextCachedNode. So the firstCachedNode is the head, and each node's previous is the one before it.

So in the cache traversal, the first node's previous should be null, and each subsequent node's previous should point to the previous node.

So in the repOK, for the cache:

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    if (firstCachedNode.getPrevious() != null) {
        return false;
    }
    LinkedListNode prev = null;
    for (LinkedListNode node : cache) {
        if (prev != null) {
            if (node.getPrevious() != prev) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        prev = node;
    }
}

Wait, but in the code, the cache is a linked list where each node's previous is the previous in the cache. So the first node's previous is null, the next node's previous is the first, etc.

So in the repOK, I need to ensure that:

- The firstCachedNode's previous is null.
- For each subsequent node in the cache, their previous is the previous node in the cache.
- The next of the last node in the cache is null.

So in code:

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    if (firstCachedNode.getPrevious() != null) {
        return false;
    }
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode currentCache = firstCachedNode;
    LinkedListNode previousCache = null;
    while (currentCache != null) {
        count++;
        if (currentCache.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (previousCache != null) {
            if (currentCache.getPrevious() != previousCache) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        if (currentCache.getNext() == null) {
            break;
        }
        previousCache = currentCache;
        currentCache = currentCache.getNext();
    }
    if (count != cacheSize) {
        return false;
    }
}

Also, need to ensure that the maximumCacheSize is correctly set, but that's a constant, so perhaps no need to check.

Another point: the header's next should be the first node in the main list, and the last node's next should be the header.

Wait, in the main list traversal, I already check that each node's next is not null, except the last which points back to header. So that's covered.

Another thing: the size variable should equal the number of nodes in the main list.

Yes, that's checked in the mainSize != size condition.

What about the firstCachedNode? It should only point to nodes that are in the cache, which are nodes that have been removed and are waiting to be reused.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should perform all these checks.

Wait, but in the code, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache if the cache isn't full. So the cache should only contain nodes that have been removed.

But in the repOK, I'm checking that each cached node's value is null. Because when a node is added to the cache, its value is set to null.

Yes, in addNodeToCache, the node's value is set to null.

So in the repOK, each cached node must have value null.

So, in the cache traversal, if any node's value is not null, return false.

Another thing: the header's previous is itself, and next is the first node or itself.

Yes, that's checked.

What about the case when the list is empty? Then header.next is header, and size is 0.

Yes, that's handled.

Another possible issue: when a node is in both the main list and the cache. But that shouldn't happen because once a node is removed, it's added to the cache, and removed from the main list.

So, the repOK should cover all these cases.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the repOK method incorporating all these checks.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header's previous and next
    if (header.getPrevious() != header || header.getNext() == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main list structure and size
    int mainSize = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.getNext();
    while (current != header) {
        mainSize++;
        if (current.getPrevious() == null || current.getNext() == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.getNext();
    }
    if (mainSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache structure
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        if (firstCachedNode == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (firstCachedNode.getPrevious() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        int cachedNodes = 0;
        LinkedListNode cacheCurrent = firstCachedNode;
        LinkedListNode prevCached = null;
        while (cacheCurrent != null) {
            cachedNodes++;
            if (cacheCurrent.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            if (prevCached != null) {
                if (cacheCurrent.getPrevious() != prevCached) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            prevCached = cacheCurrent;
            cacheCurrent = cacheCurrent.getNext();
        }
        if (cachedNodes != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
