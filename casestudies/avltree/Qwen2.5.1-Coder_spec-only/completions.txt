- **Attributes:**
  - `root`: The root node of the AVL tree.
  - `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE`: A constant representing the maximum allowed imbalance between the heights of the left and right subtrees.

- **Methods:**
  - `insert(int x)`: Inserts an element `x` into the AVL tree.
  - `remove(int x)`: Removes an element `x` from the AVL tree.
  - `findMin()`: Returns the minimum element in the AVL tree.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the AVL tree is empty.

- **Behavior:**
  - The AVL tree maintains a balance factor between the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node, ensuring that the tree remains approximately balanced.
  - The `insert` method adds a new element while maintaining the AVL property.
  - The `remove` method deletes an element while maintaining the AVL property.
  - The `findMin` method returns the smallest element in the tree.
  - The `isEmpty` method returns true if the tree has no elements, otherwise false.

- **Constraints:**
  - The height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE`.
  - The tree is dynamically adjusted to maintain balance after insertions and deletions.

To ensure the AVL tree maintains its balance properties, we need to define a representation invariant that checks the balance factor of each node. The balance factor of a node is defined as the difference in heights between its left and right subtrees. For an AVL tree, this balance factor should be between -1 and 1.

Here is the `repOK` method for the `AvlTree` class:

```java
public class AvlTree {
    private Node root;
    private static final int ALLOWED_IMBALANCE = 1;

    // Node class definition
    private static class Node {
        int key;
        int height;
        Node left;
        Node right;

        Node(int key) {
            this.key = key;
            this.height = 1;
            this.left = null;
            this.right = null;
        }
    }

    // Method to check the representation invariant
    public boolean repOK() {
        return checkBalance(root);
    }

    // Helper method to check the balance factor of each node
    private boolean checkBalance(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }

        int leftHeight = (node.left != null) ? node.left.height : 0;
        int rightHeight = (node.right != null) ? node.right.height : 0;

        // Check the balance factor
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
            return false;
        }

        // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
        return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
    }

    // Other methods (insert, remove, findMin, isEmpty) would be implemented here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Node Class**: The `Node` class represents each node in the AVL tree, containing the key, height, and pointers to the left and right children.
- **repOK Method**: This method checks the balance of the entire tree by calling the `checkBalance` helper method on the root node.
- **checkBalance Method**: This recursive method checks the balance factor of each node. It calculates the height of the left and right subtrees and ensures the balance factor is within the allowed range (`-ALLOWED_IMBALANCE` to `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE`). If any node violates this condition, the method returns `false`. Otherwise, it recursively checks the left and right subtrees.

This `repOK` method ensures that the AVL tree maintains its balance properties, which is crucial for the efficient performance of the tree operations.
