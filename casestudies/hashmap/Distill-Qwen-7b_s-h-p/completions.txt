Okay, so I need to figure out the representation invariants for the HashMap class in Java. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, what is a representation invariant? From what I remember, it's a condition that must always hold true for the object's internal state. It's something that the class ensures remains true whenever the object is in a valid state. So, these properties should be methods that return true if the object is valid.

Looking at the HashMap class, I see several fields: table, size, threshold, loadFactor, modCount, and the Entry array. There are also methods like put, get, remove, clear, and resize. These are the methods that modify the state, so their invariants might be important.

Let me start by thinking about the size and loadFactor. The size represents the number of elements in the map, and loadFactor is the ratio of the current capacity to the size. I think the invariant here is that the loadFactor should never exceed 1. Because if it does, that means the map is more than 50% full, and it should resize to make better use of space. So, size should be less than or equal to the capacity, which is determined by the loadFactor.

Next, the modCount is a volatile int used for synchronization. It's incremented every time a modification (put, get, remove) is made. The invariant here is that modCount should always be greater than 0 because it's initialized to 1 in the constructor. This ensures that concurrent modifications are detected correctly.

The threshold is calculated as (int) (capacity * loadFactor). It determines how many entries can be in the table before it needs to resize. The invariant should be that the size is less than or equal to the threshold. If the size reaches the threshold, the map will resize to increase capacity.

The table is an array of Entry objects. Each Entry has a key, value, hash, and next pointer. The invariant here is that each Entry's key should not be null, except for the Entry that represents null, which uses the NULL_KEY. Also, the Entry's next pointer should point to the next Entry in the linked list for the same bucket.

The Entry's hashCode method should follow the equals contract. That means if two Objects are equal, their hash codes must be the same, and if hash codes are the same, the objects might be equal. So, the invariant is that the hashCode method correctly implements this contract.

The Entry's equals method should correctly compare keys and values. It should handle nulls properly, meaning that if both keys are null, they are considered equal, and similarly for values.

The hash function in the HashMap class is also important. It should distribute the keys uniformly to minimize collisions. The invariant here is that the hash function correctly computes the hash code for the given key, ensuring that different keys don't collide too often, which would degrade performance.

Putting it all together, I can list these properties as the representation invariants for the HashMap class. I need to make sure each one is a boolean method that returns true if the object is valid. Also, I should only include properties that I'm completely sure are valid based on the code provided.

- Property Name: Size Invariant  
  Description: The size of the HashMap must always be less than or equal to the threshold, ensuring that the map is not overly filled and can resize appropriately.

- Property Name: Load Factor Invariant  
  Description: The load factor must not exceed 1, ensuring efficient memory usage by preventing excessive collisions.

- Property Name: ModCount Invariant  
  Description: The modCount must always be greater than 0 to ensure proper synchronization and detect concurrent modifications.

- Property Name: Threshold Invariant  
  Description: The threshold must not be exceeded by the size, indicating when a resize operation is necessary to maintain performance.

- Property Name: Entry Key Invariant  
  Description: The key in each Entry must not be null unless it is the NULL_KEY, ensuring correct null handling in hash operations.

Okay, I need to figure out the size invariant for the HashMap class. I remember that a size invariant is a condition that must always hold true for the object to function correctly. So, what's the size in this context?

Looking at the HashMap code, the size is a public int called 'size'. It starts at 0 when the map is empty. Every time an entry is added, size increments by 1. When an entry is removed, size decrements by 1. So, size should always be non-negative because you can't have a negative number of entries.

Wait, but what about the initial capacity? Oh, right, the capacity can be larger than the size, but size itself should never be negative. So the invariant should be that size is greater than or equal to 0.

Let me check the methods. The isEmpty() method returns true when size is 0, which makes sense. The addEntry() method increments size, and removeEntryForKey() decrements it. So size changes correctly.

Therefore, the size invariant is simply that size is always greater than or equal to zero.
</think>

The size invariant for the HashMap class ensures that the number of entries (size) is always non-negative.

```java
public boolean property() {
    return size >= 0;
}
```

Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariant for the HashMap class in Java. Representation invariants are crucial because they define the conditions that must hold true for the internal state of the object to be considered valid. 

Looking at the HashMap code, I see that it's a standard implementation with features like dynamic resizing, load factor, and handling of null keys. The load factor is a critical parameter that determines how full the hash table can be before it needs to be resized.

In the constructor, the load factor is set based on the initial capacity. The threshold is calculated as the product of the capacity and the load factor. This threshold determines how many entries the table can hold before it needs to resize. 

The invariant should ensure that the load factor never exceeds 0.75, as specified in the code. Additionally, the threshold should never exceed the table's capacity, which would cause the hash table to become too full and require resizing. 

So, the invariant should check two conditions: the load factor is within the allowed range and the threshold doesn't exceed the table's length. This ensures that the hash table operates efficiently and doesn't overflow beyond its capacity.
</think>

The representation invariant for the HashMap class ensures that the load factor remains within the specified bounds and that the threshold does not exceed the table's capacity.

```java
public boolean property() {
    return loadFactor <= DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR && threshold <= table.length;
}
```

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariant for the modCount variable in the HashMap class. Let me start by understanding what modCount does.

Looking at the code, modCount is a volatile int. It's used in several places, like in the put and remove methods. In the put method, modCount is incremented before adding a new entry. In the remove method, it's incremented when an entry is removed. Also, the clear method increments modCount when the entire table is cleared.

So, modCount seems to be a counter that's incremented each time a modification happens to the map. Modifications include adding, removing, or clearing entries. But wait, when the table is resized, does modCount get incremented? Let me check the resize method. No, it doesn't increment modCount. So modCount only increases when entries are added, removed, or the table is cleared.

Now, the representation invariant should state that modCount accurately reflects the number of modifications made to the map. Since modCount is incremented on every modification, the invariant should ensure that modCount is always non-negative and correctly counts each modification.

So, the property should be that modCount is greater than or equal to zero. That makes sense because it can't be negative since it's only incremented. Also, it's a boolean method, so it should return true if the invariant holds and false otherwise.

Putting it all together, the invariant is that modCount is always greater than or equal to zero. This ensures that the modCount accurately represents the number of modifications, which is crucial for the map's internal operations relying on it.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return modCount >= 0;
}
```

Okay, I need to figure out the threshold invariant for the HashMap class. Let me start by understanding what a threshold invariant is. From what I remember, a representation invariant (RI) is a condition that must always hold true for the data structure to function correctly. The threshold invariant specifically relates to the load factor and the threshold value in a hash map.

Looking at the HashMap class, I see that the load factor is a float that determines how full the hash table can get before it's resized. The threshold is calculated as (capacity * loadFactor), and it's used to decide when to resize the table.

In the constructor, when a HashMap is created, the threshold is set based on the initial capacity and the load factor. The capacity is determined by finding the next power of two greater than or equal to the initial capacity. So, for example, if the initial capacity is 10, the capacity becomes 16.

The threshold is important because it determines how many entries the hash map can hold before it needs to resize. If the number of entries exceeds the threshold, the hash map will resize to a larger capacity to maintain performance.

Now, the threshold invariant should ensure that the number of entries (size) in the hash map does not exceed the threshold. If it does, the hash map will resize. So the invariant should state that size is always less than or equal to the threshold.

I should write a boolean method that returns true if the object satisfies this invariant. The method should check if the size of the hash map is less than or equal to the threshold. If it is, return true; otherwise, return false.

Wait, but the threshold is a float, and size is an integer. Comparing them directly should be fine since the threshold is calculated as an integer (since capacity is an integer and load factor is a float, but in practice, it's cast to an int when assigning to threshold).

So the method would look something like this: return size <= threshold;

I think that's the correct invariant. It ensures that the hash map doesn't become too full, which would cause performance issues, and thus enforces the resizing mechanism.
</think>

The threshold invariant ensures that the number of entries in the hash map does not exceed the threshold, which is based on the current capacity and load factor. This invariant is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the hash map by triggering resizing when necessary.

```java
public boolean satisfiesThresholdInvariant() {
    return size <= threshold;
}
```

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariant for the Entry class in the HashMap. Representation invariants are crucial because they define the conditions that must hold true for the object's internal state to be considered valid. 

Looking at the Entry class, I see that each Entry has a key, a value, a hash, and a next pointer. The key is of type Object, and the value is also an Object. The hash is an int, and next is an Entry. 

First, I should consider the equals method. It checks if two entries are equal by comparing their keys and values. The hashCode method combines the hash of the key and the hash of the value. So, the invariant should ensure that equal entries have the same hash code and are considered equal under the same conditions.

Next, the equals method has a special case for null keys. If one key is null and the other isn't, they aren't equal. Similarly, if both keys are null, they are equal. The same logic applies to the values. So, the invariant must enforce that if two entries are equal, their keys and values must either both be null or both be non-null and equal.

Looking at the hashCode method, it returns 0 if either the key or the value is null. Otherwise, it XORs the hash codes of the key and value. This means that two different entries with null keys but different values would have different hash codes, which is correct. However, if both key and value are null, the hash code is 0, which is consistent.

I also notice that the equals method uses the equals() method of the Object class, which considers nulls. So, the invariant must align with that behavior.

Putting it all together, the invariant should state that two Entry objects are equal if and only if their keys are equal and their values are equal, considering nulls appropriately. Additionally, their hash codes must be equal if the entries are equal.

So, the property should be a boolean method that checks these conditions. It should return true if both keys are equal and both values are equal, considering nulls, and false otherwise.
</think>

```java
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == this) return true;
    if (!(o instanceof Entry)) return false;
    Entry other = (Entry) o;
    return Objects.equals(key, other.key) && Objects.equals(value, other.value);
}
```
