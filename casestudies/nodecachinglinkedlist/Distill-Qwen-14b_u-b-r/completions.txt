Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should check that all the class's invariants are maintained. Let me think about what these invariants might be.

First, looking at the class structure. The class has a header node, size, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize, and firstCachedNode. The header is a sentinel node, and the linked list is doubly linked.

So, the main invariants I can think of are:

1. The header node's previous and next should always point to itself. Because in a doubly linked list, the header acts as a sentinel, so its previous and next should be itself to handle empty cases and for traversal.

2. The size of the list should be consistent. Each time a node is added or removed, size is incremented or decremented. So, I need to ensure that size is correct.

3. The cacheSize should not exceed maximumCacheSize. The cache can't have more nodes than allowed.

4. The firstCachedNode should only be non-null if cacheSize is greater than zero. Also, the nodes in the cache should form a proper linked list, but maybe that's too detailed for repOK.

5. Each node's previous and next pointers should form a valid doubly linked list. For example, the next of the last node should point back to the header, and the previous of the first node should point to the header.

6. The nodes in the cache should have their values set to null except for the ones being used in the list. Because when a node is cached, its value is set to null to mark it as available for reuse.

Let me go through each of these points and see how to check them in repOK.

First, check the header's previous and next. So, header.getPreviousNode() should be header, and header.getNextNode() should be header. If not, something's wrong.

Next, the size should be correct. How? Well, the size is maintained by the class, but perhaps we can traverse the list and count the nodes to see if it matches the size. But that might be too time-consuming for repOK. Alternatively, maybe just check that size is non-negative, but that's not sufficient. Hmm, perhaps it's better to assume that the size is correct unless there's a clear inconsistency.

Wait, but for the repOK, it's better to have checks that are quick and cover the main invariants. So, maybe just check that size is non-negative and that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.

Wait, the maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is 20. So, cacheSize should be <= maximumCacheSize and >=0.

Another point: when a node is added to the cache, its value is set to null. So, any cached node (reachable from firstCachedNode) should have a null value. So, in repOK, I can traverse the cache nodes and ensure their values are null.

Also, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the cache should only contain nodes that have been removed and are waiting to be reused.

Another thing: the linked list should form a valid cycle. So, starting from the header, each node's next should eventually loop back to the header, and each node's previous should point to the correct node.

Wait, but checking all that might be too involved. Maybe for repOK, we can check some key points, like the header's pointers, the size is correct, the cache is within bounds, and that the firstCachedNode's value is null if it's cached.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are:

- The header's previous and next are itself.
- The size is correct (but how to check that without traversing? Maybe just ensure it's non-negative and that adding/removing affects it correctly, but that's not a direct check.)
- The cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- The firstCachedNode's value is null (since cached nodes have their values set to null).
- Each node in the cache has a null value.

So, putting this together, the repOK method would:

1. Check that header.previous == header and header.next == header.

2. Check that size >=0.

3. Check that cacheSize >=0 and cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

4. Check that if firstCachedNode is not null, then its value is null.

5. Traverse the cache nodes (starting from firstCachedNode) and ensure each has a null value and that they form a proper linked list among themselves. Wait, but the cache is a linked list? Or is it just a single linked list? Looking at the code, when adding to the cache, the node's next is set to the current firstCachedNode, and previous is set to null. So, the cache is a singly linked list, with firstCachedNode being the head, and each node's next points to the next in the cache.

So, in the cache, each node's next should eventually point to null, except the last one which points to null. Wait, no: when a node is taken from the cache, it's removed from the cache list. So, the cache is a linked list where each node's next is the next cached node.

So, in repOK, I can traverse the cache nodes starting from firstCachedNode, and for each node, check that its value is null, and that its next is either the next cached node or null.

But perhaps that's too detailed. Maybe for repOK, just check that firstCachedNode's value is null if cacheSize >0.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are:

- Header is a valid sentinel node.
- Size is correct.
- Cache size is within bounds.
- All cached nodes have null values.

So, the repOK method would look something like:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.getPreviousNode() != header || header.getNextNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that firstCachedNode is null or has null value
    if (firstCachedNode != null && firstCachedNode.getValue() != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all cached nodes have null values
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.getNextNode();
    }

    // Additional checks: perhaps that the linked list is properly formed
    // For example, the next of the last node should point back to header
    // But that might be too involved for repOK, unless it's a critical invariant.

    // Alternatively, check that the linked list forms a valid cycle
    // But that could be time-consuming.

    // Maybe for now, focus on the main invariants we can check quickly.

    return true;
}

Wait, but what about the linked list structure? If the linked list is not properly formed, that's a problem. For example, if any node's next or previous doesn't point correctly, the list could be corrupted.

So, perhaps in repOK, we should also check that the linked list is a valid cycle. That is, starting from the header, traverse next until we come back to header, and ensure that each node's previous and next form a proper cycle.

But that could be time-consuming, especially for large lists. However, for the purposes of an invariant, it's better to have it correct, even if it's slow.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK can include a check that the linked list is a valid cycle.

So, adding that:

// Check that the linked list forms a valid cycle
LinkedListNode current = header.getNextNode();
int count = 0;
while (current != header && count < size) {
    if (current.getPreviousNode().getPreviousNode() != current.getPreviousNode()) {
        // If any node's previous's previous is not itself, the list is corrupted
        return false;
    }
    current = current.getNextNode();
    count++;
}
if (count != size) {
    return false;
}

Wait, that might not be sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps check that each node's previous and next form a proper cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps the main check is that the linked list is a cycle where each node's previous and next are correctly linked, and that the header is the sentinel.

But this could get complicated. Maybe for the repOK, it's better to include as many checks as possible, even if they are time-consuming.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would include:

- Header's previous and next are itself.
- Size is non-negative.
- Cache size is within 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- All cached nodes have null values.
- The linked list forms a valid cycle, with each node's previous and next correctly pointing, and the total number of nodes (excluding header) is equal to size.

Wait, but the header is part of the linked list, but it's a sentinel. So, the actual nodes are the ones after the header.

So, perhaps the count should be size, and the traversal from header.next should loop back to header after size steps.

So, in code:

// Check linked list cycle
current = header.getNextNode();
count = 0;
while (current != header) {
    if (current.getPreviousNode() == null || current.getPreviousNode().getNextNode() != current) {
        return false;
    }
    current = current.getNextNode();
    count++;
}
if (count != size) {
    return false;
}

This would ensure that the linked list is properly formed, each node's previous points correctly, and the total number of nodes is size.

So, including all these checks in repOK.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would have these checks.

To ensure the `NodeCachingLinkedList` maintains its invariants, the `repOK` method performs several checks:

1. **Header Integrity**: The header node's previous and next must point to itself.
2. **Size Validity**: The size must be non-negative.
3. **Cache Bounds**: The cache size must be within the allowed range.
4. **Cached Node Values**: All nodes in the cache must have `null` values.
5. **Linked List Structure**: The linked list must form a valid cycle with correct node connections and the correct number of nodes.

Here is the `repOK` method implementing these checks:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header's previous and next point to itself
    if (header.getPreviousNode() != header || header.getNextNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all cached nodes have null values
    LinkedListNode currentCached = firstCachedNode;
    while (currentCached != null) {
        if (currentCached.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        currentCached = currentCached.getNextNode();
    }

    // Check linked list structure and size consistency
    LinkedListNode current = header.getNextNode();
    int count = 0;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.getPreviousNode() == null || current.getPreviousNode().getNextNode() != current) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.getNextNode();
        count++;
    }
    if (count != size) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
