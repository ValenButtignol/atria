Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the TreeMap class. The representation invariant is a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the TreeMap class and its structure. TreeMap is a balanced binary search tree that maintains sorted order based on the comparator. It has nodes with keys, values, colors (for balancing), left and right children, and a parent.

The key properties I need to check are:

1. **Null Check for Comparator**: The comparator should not be null because TreeMap relies on it for comparisons. If it's null, the tree can't function properly.

2. **Root Node Check**: The root should not be null. If it's null, the tree is empty, but that's only valid if the size is zero.

3. **Size Check**: The size should be consistent with the structure of the tree. If the size is not equal to the number of nodes, something is wrong.

4. **Parent-Child Links**: Each node (except the root) must have a parent, and the parent must correctly link to its children. Also, the root's parent should be null.

5. **Color Constraints**: The root should always be black. Nodes can be red or black, but certain conditions must be met during rotations to maintain the invariants.

6. **Balancing After Insertions**: After inserting a node, the fixInsertion method should have been called, ensuring the tree remains balanced.

Now, I'll structure the repOK method to check these points.

- Check if the comparator is null. If so, return false.
- Check if the root is null. If so, check if size is zero. If not, return false.
- Check if the size is equal to the number of nodes. If not, return false.
- Ensure each node (except root) has a parent and that the parent's left and right children are correctly set.
- Verify the root's color is black.
- Ensure that after any insertion, the fixInsertion method has been called, which would have balanced the tree.

I need to make sure each of these checks is accurate and covers all possible invalid states. If any check fails, repOK returns false, indicating the tree is invalid.

I should also consider edge cases, like an empty tree, a single node, and larger trees with multiple rotations. Each case should be validated to ensure the invariant holds.

Finally, I'll write the repOK method, making sure it efficiently checks all these conditions without unnecessary computations.

To determine if a `TreeMap` object is valid, we need to ensure that the tree adheres to the expected structure and properties. Here's the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if comparator is null
    if (comparator == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if root is null
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    }

    // Check if size is consistent with the number of nodes
    if (size != (root == null ? 0 : (leftmostNode() != null ? leftmostNode().size() : 0))) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check parent-child links
    if (!checkParentChildLinks()) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check root color
    if (root.color != BLACK) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if fixInsertion has been called after insertion
    if (size > 0 && !hasFixInsertionBeenCalled()) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

// Helper method to check parent-child links
private boolean checkParentChildLinks() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check root's parent
    if (root.parent != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all other nodes
    for (Node node : allNodes()) {
        if (node.parent == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (node.parent.left == node || node.parent.right == node) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Helper method to check if fixInsertion has been called after insertion
private boolean hasFixInsertionBeenCalled() {
    // Check if any node has been rotated
    if (root != null && root.color == RED) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if any rotation occurred during insertion
    if (hasRotationOccurred()) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

// Helper method to check if rotation occurred
private boolean hasRotationOccurred() {
    return (root != null && root.color == RED) || (root.left != null && root.left.color == RED) || 
           (root.right != null && root.right.color == RED);
}
```

This method ensures that the `TreeMap` is in a valid state by checking the comparator, root node, size consistency, parent-child links, root color, and whether balancing operations have been performed after insertions.
