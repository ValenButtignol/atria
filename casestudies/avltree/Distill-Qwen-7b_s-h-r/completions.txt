Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Representation invariants are boolean methods that check if the object's state is valid. So, I should think about what makes an AvlTree valid.

First, the tree must be a valid AVL tree. AVL trees have a balance condition where the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees (the balance factor) can't be more than 1. So, each node's balance factor must be -1, 0, or 1.

Looking at the code, the height method returns -1 for null nodes. That's correct because the height of a null node is considered -1, which helps in calculating the height of its parent.

The balance method is called after insertions and deletions to maintain the AVL property. It checks the balance factor of each node and rotates the tree if necessary to keep it balanced. So, after every insertion or deletion, the tree should be balanced.

The root node's balance factor is crucial. If the root's balance factor is not within -1, 0, or 1, the tree is unbalanced. So, the representation invariant should check that the root's balance factor is within this range.

Also, the root can't be null if the tree isn't empty. Wait, no, the isEmpty() method checks if root is null. So, if the tree is empty, root is null, and if it's not, root is non-null. That's correct.

Another thing to consider is that all nodes must have consistent heights. The height method correctly calculates the height as the max of left and right heights plus one. So, each node's height is correctly maintained.

Putting it all together, the key points are:
1. The root must not be null if the tree isn't empty.
2. The root's balance factor must be within -1, 0, or 1.
3. All other nodes' heights and balances are maintained by the balance method, so they should be valid as long as the root is balanced.

So, the repOK method should check if the root is not null (if the tree isn't empty) and that the root's balance factor is within the allowed range. If either condition fails, the tree is unbalanced.

Wait, but the root's balance factor is maintained by the balance method. So, if the tree was previously balanced and an operation caused it to become unbalanced, the balance method would have already rotated it, making the root balanced again. So, after any operation, the root should be balanced.

Therefore, the repOK method can simply check if the root is not null (tree isn't empty) and that the root's balance factor is within -1, 0, or 1.

So, the method would look like:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    AvlNode rootNode = root;
    return (Math.abs(rootNode.height - (-rootNode.height)) <= 1);
}

Wait, no. The balance factor is the left height minus the right height. So, for the root, the balance factor is height(left) - height(right). So, the condition should be that this difference is between -1 and 1, inclusive.

So, the correct condition is:

Math.abs(rootNode.height - (-rootNode.height)) <= 1

Wait, no. Let me think again. The height of the root is the max of left and right heights plus one. The balance factor is left height minus right height. So, for the root, the balance factor should be between -1 and 1.

So, the condition is:

Math.abs(rootNode.leftHeight - rootNode.rightHeight) <= 1

But in the code, the root's height is stored as an integer. So, the root's height is the max of left and right heights plus one. So, the balance factor is left height minus right height.

So, the condition is that the root's left height minus right height is between -1 and 1.

But how do I get the left and right heights of the root? The root has left and right children, which are AvlNodes. So, I can get their heights using the height() method.

So, the condition is:

Math.abs(height(root.left) - height(root.right)) <= 1

But wait, the root's height is stored as an integer. So, the root's height is the max of left and right heights plus one. So, the balance factor is left height minus right height.

So, the condition is that the balance factor is within -1, 0, or 1.

Therefore, the repOK method should check that the root is not null and that the absolute difference between the left and right subtree heights is at most 1.

So, the code would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(root.left);
    int rightHeight = height(root.right);
    return Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1;
}

Wait, but the root's height is stored as an integer. So, the root's height is the max of left and right heights plus one. So, the balance factor is left height minus right height.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the repOK method checks that the root is not null and that the root's left and right subtree heights differ by at most 1.

I think that's the correct representation invariant for the AvlTree class.

To ensure the AvlTree class maintains its AVL tree properties, the representation invariant must verify that the tree remains balanced after each operation. The key checks are:

1. The root must not be null if the tree isn't empty.
2. The root's left and right subtree heights must differ by at most 1.

Here's the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(root.left);
    int rightHeight = height(root.right);
    return Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) <= 1;
}
```
