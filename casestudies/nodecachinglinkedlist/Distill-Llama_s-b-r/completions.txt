Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Hmm, what's a representation invariant? From what I remember, it's a method that checks if the current state of the object is consistent with its invariants. So, this method should return true if the object's state is valid, and false otherwise.

Looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class, it has several fields: header, size, cacheSize, firstCachedNode, maximumCacheSize, and DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. The class manages a linked list with caching. When nodes are added, they might be cached, and when removed, they're added back to the cache.

First, I should think about what invariants are present in this class. The header should always point to the first node. The size should correctly reflect the number of nodes in the list. The cache should not exceed the maximum cache size. Also, when a node is added, if it's not in the cache, it should be added to the cache up to the maximum size. When a node is removed, it should be added back to the cache if there's space.

So, the repOK method needs to check these conditions. Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if the header's next is the first node. If not, the list is inconsistent.
2. Ensure that the size is correct. Maybe compare the size with the number of nodes in the linked list.
3. Verify that the cache size doesn't exceed the maximum cache size.
4. Check if all nodes are properly linked. The previous and next pointers should form a correct linked list.
5. Ensure that when a node is removed, it's added back to the cache if possible.

Wait, how do I check if all nodes are properly linked? Maybe by traversing the list and ensuring each node's previous and next pointers are correct.

Also, when adding a node, if the cache is full, the node shouldn't be added to the cache. But in the addNodeToCache method, it returns if the cache is full, so that's handled.

Another thing: when removing a node, it's added back to the cache. So, after removal, the cache size should be correctly updated.

Let me think about how to implement this. The repOK method will perform several checks:

- Check that the header's next is the first node.
- Check that the size matches the count of nodes in the list.
- Check that the cache size is not more than the maximum.
- Traverse the list to ensure all nodes are linked correctly.

Wait, how do I count the nodes? I can start from the header and traverse each node until I reach the end.

Also, I should ensure that the firstCachedNode is correctly pointing to the first node in the cache.

Let me outline the code steps:

1. If the header's next is not the first node, return false.
2. Traverse the list starting from the header and count the nodes. If the count doesn't match the size, return false.
3. Check if cacheSize > maximumCacheSize. If so, return false.
4. Traverse the cache to ensure all nodes are properly linked. If any node's previous or next is incorrect, return false.
5. Additionally, check that when a node is removed, it's added back to the cache. But since the removeNode method calls addNodeToCache, maybe that's already handled.

Wait, but the repOK method should be a single check. So, perhaps it's sufficient to check the header, size, cache limits, and node links.

I think that's a good start. Now, let me write the code.

First, check if the header's next is the first node. So, header.next should be equal to firstCachedNode.

Then, count the number of nodes in the list. Start from header.next and traverse until node == header. The count should equal size.

Next, check if cacheSize > maximumCacheSize. If yes, return false.

Then, check the links. Starting from the first node, ensure each node's previous and next are correctly set.

Wait, but how do I get the first node? It's header.next. So, I can start from there.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks and return true if all are satisfied, else false.

I think that covers the main invariants. Now, let me write the code accordingly.

To determine if the `NodeCachingLinkedList` is in a consistent state, we need to verify several invariants. These invariants ensure that the object's internal data structures are correctly maintained and that all operations have been performed properly.

### Representation Invariant (`repOK` Method)

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header's next is the first node
    if (!Objects.equals(header.next, firstCachedNode)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the size matches the actual number of nodes
    int actualSize = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the cache size exceeds the maximum cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if all nodes are properly linked
    LinkedListNode firstNode = header.next;
    if (firstNode == null) {
        // The list is empty, which is allowed
        return true;
    }

    // Check the links for the first node
    if (!Objects.equals(firstNode.getPreviousNode(), header) ||
        !Objects.equals(firstNode.getNextNode(), header.next)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check the links for the last node
    LinkedListNode lastNode = header.getPreviousNode();
    if (lastNode != null) {
        if (!Objects.equals(lastNode.getNextNode(), header) ||
            !Objects.equals(lastNode.getPreviousNode(), header)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check the links for all intermediate nodes
    current = firstNode.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (!Objects.equals(current.getPreviousNode(), current.previous) ||
            !Objects.equals(current.getNextNode(), current.next)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

The `repOK` method performs the following checks to ensure the `NodeCachingLinkedList` is in a consistent state:

1. **Header Check**: Verifies that the header's next node is the first cached node.
2. **Size Check**: Counts the number of nodes in the list and compares it with the `size` field to ensure they match.
3. **Cache Size Check**: Ensures the cache size does not exceed the maximum cache size.
4. **Node Linking Check**: Traverses the list to ensure all nodes are properly linked, starting from the first node, through intermediate nodes, and ending at the last node.

This method returns `true` if all checks pass, indicating the object's state is consistent with its invariants. If any check fails, it returns `false`, indicating an inconsistent state.
