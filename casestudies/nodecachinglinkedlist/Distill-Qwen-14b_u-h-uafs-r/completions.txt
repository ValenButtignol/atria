Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me start by understanding what this class does. 

From the code, I see that it's a linked list that caches nodes to optimize performance. The class has a header node, size, and cache-related variables. The maximum cache size is set to 20 by default. When nodes are removed, they're added back to the cache if there's space. 

The representation invariant should check the internal consistency of the object. So, I need to think about all the invariants that must hold true for the object to be valid.

First, the header node is always present. So, I should check that header is not null. Also, the size should be non-negative because you can't have a negative number of nodes.

Next, the cache size can't exceed the maximum cache size. So, cacheSize should be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. Also, cacheSize should be non-negative.

Now, looking at the linked list structure, each node should have correct previous and next pointers. For the header node, its previous should point to itself, and its next should point to the first actual node or itself if the list is empty. For other nodes, their previous and next should not be null unless they're at the ends of the list.

I also need to ensure that the firstCachedNode is either null or a valid node that's part of the cache. Additionally, any node in the cache should have its value set to null to indicate it's cached and not in use.

Another important point is that the size of the linked list should match the number of nodes that are not in the cache. So, I'll need a helper method to count the nodes that are currently active (not cached).

I should also check that the header's next node is either the first node or the header itself if the list is empty. Similarly, the header's previous should always point to itself.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform several checks:

1. Header is not null.
2. Size is non-negative.
3. Cache size is within bounds (0 to maximumCacheSize).
4. Header's previous and next are correctly set.
5. All nodes in the list have valid previous and next pointers.
6. FirstCachedNode is either null or a valid cached node.
7. Cached nodes have null values.
8. The size of the linked list matches the count of active nodes.

I'll need to implement helper methods to count active nodes and traverse the list to check each node's structure. If any of these conditions fail, the invariant returns false; otherwise, it returns true.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header is not null
    if (header == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check header's previous and next
    if (header.getPreviousNode() != header || header.getNextNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all nodes have valid previous and next pointers
    LinkedListNode currentNode = header.getNextNode();
    while (currentNode != header) {
        if (currentNode.getPreviousNode() == null || currentNode.getNextNode() == null) {
            return false;
        }
        currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
    }

    // Check firstCachedNode is either null or a valid cached node
    if (firstCachedNode != null && !isCached(firstCachedNode)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check all cached nodes have null values
    LinkedListNode cachedNode = firstCachedNode;
    while (cachedNode != null) {
        if (cachedNode.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        cachedNode = cachedNode.getNextNode();
    }

    // Check size matches the number of active nodes
    int activeNodes = countActiveNodes();
    if (activeNodes != size) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private boolean isCached(LinkedListNode node) {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current == node) {
            return true;
        }
        current = current.getNextNode();
    }
    return false;
}

private int countActiveNodes() {
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode currentNode = header.getNextNode();
    while (currentNode != header) {
        if (currentNode.getValue() != null) {
            count++;
        }
        currentNode = currentNode.getNextNode();
    }
    return count;
}
```
