Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me look at the code and understand what it does.

First, the class has several attributes: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. The header is a LinkedListNode, which I assume is the starting point of the linked list. The size attribute keeps track of the number of nodes in the list. The cache-related attributes are firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. It looks like the class is designed to cache nodes in a linked list to improve performance, especially when dealing with frequent additions and removals.

The constructor initializes the header, size, cacheSize, firstCachedNode, and sets the default maximum cache size to 20. So, by default, the cache can hold up to 20 nodes.

Looking at the methods, there's add(Object value) which adds a node to the end of the linked list. It uses addLast, which in turn calls addNodeBefore, creating a new node if necessary. The remove(Object value) method searches for a node with the given value and removes it, adding it to the cache. The addNodeToCache method adds a node to the cache if there's space; otherwise, it does nothing. The createNode method checks if a node is already in the cache. If not, it creates a new one; if it is, it updates the value.

The removeNode method removes the node from the linked list and adds it to the cache. The super_removeNode method handles the actual removal from the linked list by adjusting the previous and next pointers.

The LinkedListNode inner class has methods to get and set previous and next nodes, and to get and set the value. It seems like each node can have a value and links to previous and next nodes.

So, the class's main purpose is to manage a linked list with caching to avoid creating new nodes unnecessarily. When a node is added, if it's not in the cache, a new node is created. If it is in the cache, its value is updated. When a node is removed from the linked list, it's added to the cache if there's space.

Key properties include maintaining the linked list structure, ensuring that the cache doesn't exceed its maximum size, and handling node values correctly. The size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in both the linked list and the cache.

I need to capture all this behavior in an informal specification. I'll start by outlining the purpose of the class, then describe its attributes and methods, and finally list the key properties and constraints.

**Informal Specification for NodeCachingLinkedList Class**

**Purpose:**
The NodeCachingLinkedList class manages a linked list with a cache to optimize node operations. It ensures efficient addition and removal of nodes by caching frequently accessed nodes, reducing the need to create new nodes repeatedly.

**Attributes:**
- **header (LinkedListNode):** The starting node of the linked list.
- **size (int):** Tracks the total number of nodes in the linked list, including those in the cache.
- **DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE (int):** Default maximum number of nodes the cache can hold, set to 20.
- **firstCachedNode (LinkedListNode):** Reference to the first node in the cache.
- **cacheSize (int):** Current number of nodes in the cache.
- **maximumCacheSize (int):** Maximum allowed number of nodes in the cache.

**Methods:**
1. **add(Object value):** Adds a new node to the end of the linked list. If the node's value is already in the cache, it updates the cached node's value instead of creating a new one.
2. **remove(Object value):** Removes a node from the linked list if it exists. The removed node is added to the cache if there's space available.
3. **createNode(Object value):** Creates a new node if it's not in the cache. If the node is already in the cache, it updates the cached node's value.
4. **addNodeToCache(LinkedListNode node):** Adds a node to the cache if there's space. If the cache is full, the method does nothing.
5. **getNodeFromCache():** Retrieves a node from the cache, advancing to the next cached node and decrementing the cache size.
6. **isCacheFull():** Checks if the cache has reached its maximum size.
7. **super_removeNode(LinkedListNode node):** Removes a node from the linked list by adjusting the previous and next pointers.

**Properties:**
- **Linked List Structure:** Maintains a doubly linked list where each node has references to its previous and next nodes.
- **Cache Management:** Nodes are cached to avoid repeated creation, with a maximum cache size to prevent memory issues.
- **Unique Values:** Each node holds a unique value, ensuring no duplicates in the cache.
- **Consistent Size:** The size attribute accurately reflects the total number of nodes in the linked list and cache.
- **No Cycles:** The linked list structure remains acyclic, ensuring proper traversal and manipulation.

**Constraints:**
- The cache size must not exceed the specified maximum.
- Nodes added to the cache must be unique to avoid overwriting existing values.
- The linked list must remain a valid structure with correct pointers to previous and next nodes.

This specification captures the behavior, attributes, and constraints of the NodeCachingLinkedList class, ensuring efficient node management through caching while maintaining the integrity of the linked list structure.

### Specification:

**Class: HashMap**

**Attributes:**
- `table`: An array of Entry objects representing the hash table.
- `size`: The number of key-value mappings in the map.
- `threshold`: The threshold for resizing the hash table.
- `loadFactor`: The load factor for the hash table.
- `modCount`: A volatile integer to track modifications.

**Methods:**
- `HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)`: Constructor to initialize the hash map with a specified initial capacity and load factor.
- `HashMap(int initialCapacity)`: Constructor to initialize the hash map with a specified initial capacity and the default load factor.
- `HashMap()`: Constructor to initialize the hash map with the default initial capacity and load factor.
- `int size()`: Returns the number of key-value mappings in the map.
- `boolean isEmpty()`: Returns true if the map contains no key-value mappings.
- `Object get(Object key)`: Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key.
- `Object put(Object key, Object value)`: Associates the specified value with the specified key in the map and returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was no mapping for the key.
- `Object remove(Object key)`: Removes the mapping of the specified key from this map if present and returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was no mapping for the key.
- `void clear()`: Removes all of the mappings from this map.

**Constraints:**
- The initial capacity must be non-negative.
- The load factor must be positive.
- The hash table is resized when the number of entries exceeds the threshold, which is calculated as the product of the current capacity and the load factor.
- The hash table uses chaining to handle collisions.
- The `Entry` class represents a key-value pair in the hash table.

To ensure the integrity of the `HashMap` class, we need to define a `repOK` method that checks the representation invariants. Here are the constraints and invariants that need to be checked:

1. **Initial Capacity and Load Factor Constraints:**
   - The initial capacity must be non-negative.
   - The load factor must be positive.

2. **Threshold Calculation:**
   - The threshold should be calculated as the product of the current capacity and the load factor.

3. **Table Initialization:**
   - The `table` array should be initialized with the correct capacity.
   - Each entry in the `table` array should be `null`.

4. **Size Constraint:**
   - The `size` attribute should not exceed the number of non-null entries in the `table`.

5. **ModCount Constraint:**
   - The `modCount` attribute should be a non-negative integer.

6. **Entry Integrity:**
   - Each `Entry` in the `table` should have a valid hash, key, value, and next pointer.

Here is the `repOK` method that checks these constraints:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check initial capacity and load factor constraints
    if (initialCapacity < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (loadFactor <= 0 || Float.isNaN(loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check threshold calculation
    if (threshold != (int) (table.length * loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check table initialization
    if (table == null || table.length != capacity) {
        return false;
    }
    for (Entry e : table) {
        if (e != null) {
            if (e.key == null || e.value == null || e.hash < 0 || e.next == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check size constraint
    int actualSize = 0;
    for (Entry e : table) {
        while (e != null) {
            actualSize++;
            e = e.next;
        }
    }
    if (size != actualSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check modCount constraint
    if (modCount < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Capacity and Load Factor:** The method first checks if the initial capacity is non-negative and the load factor is positive.
- **Threshold Calculation:** It verifies that the threshold is correctly calculated as the product of the current capacity and the load factor.
- **Table Initialization:** It checks that the `table` array is initialized with the correct capacity and that each entry in the `table` array is either `null` or has a valid hash, key, value, and next pointer.
- **Size Constraint:** It calculates the actual size of the map by iterating through the `table` and counts the number of non-null entries. It then checks if this count matches the `size` attribute.
- **ModCount Constraint:** It ensures that the `modCount` attribute is a non-negative integer.

This `repOK` method helps ensure that the `HashMap` class maintains its invariants and behaves correctly.
