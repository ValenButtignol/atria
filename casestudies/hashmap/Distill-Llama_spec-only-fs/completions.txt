Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the HashMap class. Let me look at the code and understand what it does.

First, the HashMap class has several static constants: DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY, MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, and DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR. These are used to set up the initial size and maximum size of the hash map. The DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY is 16, which is a common starting point for hash tables to balance performance and memory usage. MAXIMUM_CAPACITY is set to 1 << 30, which is a very large number, so it's unlikely that the hash map will ever reach this capacity in typical use cases. The DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR is 0.75, which means that the hash map will expand its capacity when the number of elements reaches 75% of the current capacity.

The class has several instance variables: table, size, threshold, loadFactor, and modCount. The table is an array of Entry objects, which store the key-value pairs. The size variable keeps track of the number of elements in the hash map. Threshold is used to determine when the hash map should resize. loadFactor is the load factor used to calculate the threshold. modCount is a volatile integer used to track the number of times the hash map has been modified, which is useful for detecting concurrent modifications in multi-threaded environments.

The constructor initializes the hash map with a given initial capacity and load factor. It checks for invalid initial capacities and load factors, ensuring that the initial capacity doesn't exceed the maximum capacity. It then calculates the capacity by finding the next power of two greater than or equal to the initial capacity. The threshold is set to the capacity multiplied by the load factor. The table is initialized to hold null entries.

There are several utility methods: maskNull, hash, indexFor, get, put, remove, contains, size, isEmpty, and clear. The maskNull method converts null keys to a special NULL_KEY object to handle nulls uniformly. The hash method computes a hash code for an object, which is used to determine the bucket in the hash table. The indexFor method calculates the index in the table array based on the hash code and the length of the array.

The get method retrieves a value from the hash map by computing the hash code of the key, finding the corresponding bucket, and then traversing the linked list of entries in that bucket to find the matching key. The put method adds a new key-value pair to the hash map. It computes the hash code, finds the bucket, and either inserts a new entry or replaces an existing one. It also increments the modCount to indicate a structural modification.

The remove method deletes a key-value pair from the hash map. It uses the get method to find the entry and then removes it, updating the size and modCount accordingly. The clear method removes all entries from the hash map, resetting the table and size.

The resize method is called when the hash map needs to expand. It checks if the current capacity is the maximum allowed. If not, it creates a new table with double the capacity, transfers all entries to the new table, and updates the threshold. The transfer method moves all entries from the old table to the new table, maintaining the order of entries in each bucket.

The addEntry method is used to add a new entry to the hash map. It creates a new Entry object, places it in the appropriate bucket, and checks if resizing is needed based on the threshold.

The Entry inner class represents each entry in the hash map. It has a key, value, hash code, and a reference to the next entry in the linked list. The equals and hashCode methods are overridden to compare entries based on their keys and values.

Now, to write the informal specification, I need to describe the behavior, attributes, and properties of the HashMap class. I should mention that it's a hash-based data structure that allows average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and accesses. The hash function should distribute the entries as uniformly as possible across the table to minimize collisions. The load factor determines when the table will be resized to accommodate more entries, ensuring that the hash map doesn't become too full and slow down insertions and lookups.

I should also note that the hash map uses a linked list to handle bucket collisions, which allows for efficient traversal when multiple entries hash to the same bucket. The modCount variable is important for detecting concurrent modifications, which is crucial in multi-threaded environments to prevent inconsistent states.

Additionally, I should mention that the hash map does not allow null keys or values, as the maskNull method converts nulls to a special key. The size method returns the number of entries, and the isEmpty method checks if the size is zero.

In summary, the HashMap class provides a data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves key-value pairs using hashing, with mechanisms to handle resizing and collisions to maintain performance.

### Informal Specification for the HashMap Class

**Behavior:**
The HashMap class implements a hash-based data structure that allows efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute hash codes for keys, distributing entries across a table of fixed size. The table is dynamically resized when it reaches a specified threshold, determined by a load factor. The class supports the following operations:
- **Insertion (put):** Adds a new key-value pair, replacing an existing entry if the key is already present.
- **Removal (remove):** Deletes a key-value pair, returning the value if the key was present.
- **Retrieval (get):** Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
- **Clearing:** Removes all entries from the hash map.
- **Resizing:** Dynamically adjusts the size of the table to maintain performance.

**Attributes:**
- **table (Entry[]):** An array of Entry objects, each representing a key-value pair in the hash map.
- **size (int):** The number of entries currently in the hash map.
- **threshold (int):** The maximum number of entries allowed in the table before resizing.
- **loadFactor (float):** A factor used to determine when to resize the table.
- **modCount (volatile int):** A counter used to detect concurrent modifications in multi-threaded environments.

**Properties:**
- **Uniform Distribution:** Entries are distributed across the table as uniformly as possible to minimize collisions.
- **Load Factor:** The table is resized when the number of entries exceeds the threshold, which is calculated as the capacity multiplied by the load factor.
- **No Nulls:** The hash map does not allow null keys or values, converting nulls to a special key for handling.
- **Efficient Access:** Average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and accesses due to the hash function and linked list structure for buckets.

**Constraints:**
- **Capacity:** The table size is determined by the initial capacity and can be increased up to a maximum capacity.
- **Load Factor:** The load factor determines the threshold for resizing, ensuring the hash map remains efficient as it grows.

**Key Features:**
- **Hashing:** Uses a custom hash function to distribute entries efficiently.
- **Resizing:** Dynamically adjusts the table size to accommodate more entries, ensuring good performance.
- **Collision Handling:** Uses linked lists to manage buckets, allowing efficient traversal when multiple entries hash to the same bucket.
- **Concurrent Modification Detection:** Uses modCount to detect changes in the hash map, useful in multi-threaded environments.

**Summary:**
The HashMap class provides a high-performance data structure for storing and retrieving key-value pairs, leveraging hashing for efficient operations and dynamic resizing to maintain performance as the data grows.
