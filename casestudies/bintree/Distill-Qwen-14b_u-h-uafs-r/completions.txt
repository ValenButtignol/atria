Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. Let me think about what the class does and what invariants it should satisfy.

First, the BinTree class represents a binary tree. It has a root node and a size variable. The add method adds nodes recursively, and there's a Node class with left and right children and an info field.

The representation invariant should check that the object's state is valid. So, what could go wrong? Well, the size variable might not match the actual number of nodes. Also, the tree structure might have inconsistencies, like a node pointing to a parent that doesn't have it as a child.

Let me start by checking the size. The size variable should equal the number of nodes in the tree. So, I can write a method to count the nodes and compare it to size.

Next, I need to ensure the tree structure is correct. For each node, its left and right children should be valid. That means if a node has a left child, the child's parent should point back correctly. Same for the right child.

I should also check that the root is either null (empty tree) or a valid Node instance.

Let me outline the steps:

1. If the tree is empty (root is null), size should be 0.
2. If the tree isn't empty, size should be at least 1.
3. Traverse the tree to count nodes and ensure it matches size.
4. For each node, check that left and right children's parent references are correct.

Wait, how do I traverse the tree? Maybe a helper method to count nodes recursively. Also, for each node, I can check its children's parent fields.

I should also handle cases where a node's left or right is null, ensuring that if they are not null, their parent is correctly set.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will:

- Check if root is null, then size must be 0.
- Else, size must be >=1.
- Count the nodes and compare to size.
- For each node, verify left and right children's parent references.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle all these checks.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    }
    
    if (size < 1) {
        return false;
    }
    
    int nodeCount = countNodes(root);
    if (nodeCount != size) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return isTreeStructureValid(root);
}

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
}

private boolean isTreeStructureValid(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if (node.left != null && node.left.parent != node) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (node.right != null && node.right.parent != node) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return isTreeStructureValid(node.left) && isTreeStructureValid(node.right);
}
```
