Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The repOK method should return true if the object is valid and false otherwise. Let me think about what properties the AvlTree must satisfy.

First, the tree is an AVL tree, so each node must have a balance factor that's either -1, 0, or 1. The balance factor is the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees. So for every node, height(left) - height(right) should be within [-1, 0, 1].

Next, the tree must maintain the AVL tree properties after any insertions or deletions. That means after each operation, the tree is rebalanced correctly. So I need to ensure that every subtree is balanced.

Also, the root should never be null unless the tree is empty. Wait, no, the root is null when the tree is empty, which is allowed. So the root can be null or a valid node.

Each node's height must be correctly calculated. The height of a node is the maximum height of its children plus one. So for every node, height = max(left.height, right.height) + 1. I should check that this holds for all nodes.

Additionally, the elements in the left subtree of any node should be less than the node's element, and the right subtree should have greater elements. This maintains the binary search tree property.

So putting it all together, the repOK method should:

1. Check that all nodes have a balance factor within [-1, 1].
2. Verify that each node's height is correctly computed as max(left.height, right.height) + 1.
3. Ensure that the tree is a valid binary search tree, meaning left children are less than the parent and right children are greater.
4. Ensure that the root is either null (empty tree) or a valid node.

I'll need to traverse the tree to check each node. Maybe perform a post-order traversal, checking each node's properties. Also, check that the root is not null when the tree isn't empty.

Wait, the root can be null, which is the case for an empty tree. So in that case, the tree is valid. Otherwise, for a non-null root, all the above conditions must hold.

I should also consider edge cases, like a tree with just one node. That should be balanced, height 0, and no children.

So the repOK method will:

- If root is null, return true (empty tree is valid).
- Else, traverse each node, checking balance, height, and BST properties.
- If any node fails these checks, return false.

I'll write a helper method to check each node. For each node, compute left and right heights, check balance, check height correctness, and BST property.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the repOK method accordingly.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return checkNode(root);
}

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    int balance = leftHeight - rightHeight;

    // Check balance condition
    if (Math.abs(balance) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height condition
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check BST property
    if (node.left != null && node.left.element >= node.element) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.right != null && node.right.element <= node.element) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return checkNode(node.left) && checkNode(node.right);
}
```
