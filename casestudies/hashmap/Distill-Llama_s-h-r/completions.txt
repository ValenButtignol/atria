Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I should understand what a representation invariant is. It's a method that checks if the current state of the object is consistent with its invariants. So, it should verify that all the internal invariants of the HashMap are satisfied.

Looking at the HashMap code, I see several key properties that must hold true for the object to be valid. Let me list them out:

1. **Threshold Check**: The threshold should be greater than or equal to the size of the map. If the size exceeds the threshold, resizing should have occurred. So, I need to ensure that size <= threshold.

2. **Table Size and Threshold**: The table's length (capacity) should be a power of two, as per the initial setup. Also, the threshold should be correctly calculated based on the capacity and load factor.

3. **ModCount Consistency**: The modCount variable is used for detecting concurrent modifications. It should be equal to the number of times addEntry, removeEntryForKey, or clear has been called. So, modCount should equal the number of structural modifications.

4. **Load Factor Check**: The load factor should be between 0 and 1 (exclusive). So, I need to ensure that loadFactor is within this range.

5. **Table Initialization**: The table should be initialized with the correct capacity and all entries should be null initially.

6. **No Duplicate Keys in Initialization**: After initialization, each key should have a unique hash code, but since the table is an array, each bucket can have multiple entries, but each entry's hash should be unique within the bucket.

Wait, no, actually, in a HashMap, each key has a unique hash code, but multiple entries can end up in the same bucket if their hash codes collide. So, the hash codes don't have to be unique across the entire table, just within each bucket.

But for the repOK method, I should check that the current state is consistent. So, I need to ensure that all the internal invariants are maintained.

Let me think about each of these points and how to translate them into checks in the repOK method.

1. **Threshold Check**: The size should not exceed the threshold. So, if size > threshold, the map is invalid.

2. **Table Size and Threshold**: The capacity should be a power of two. Also, the threshold should be (int)(capacity * loadFactor). So, I can check if capacity is a power of two and if threshold is correctly calculated.

3. **ModCount Consistency**: Each time a structural modification is made (like add, remove, clear), modCount is incremented. So, the current modCount should equal the number of such operations performed. But since the repOK method can't track the number of operations, perhaps it's sufficient to check that modCount is not zero unless no operations have been performed. Alternatively, it's enough to ensure that modCount is consistent with the number of modifications, but without knowing the number, it's tricky. Maybe just check that modCount is not negative and that it's equal to the number of times addEntry, removeEntryForKey, or clear has been called. But since the repOK method can't track that, perhaps it's sufficient to check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of structural modifications. However, since the method can't track the number, maybe it's enough to check that modCount is not negative and that it's equal to the number of times it's been incremented. But that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the modCount can be checked for consistency with the size and other factors, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's sufficient to check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of structural modifications, but without knowing the number, perhaps it's better to just check that modCount is non-negative and that it's consistent with the size. Hmm, maybe I should just check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of structural modifications, but since I can't track that, perhaps it's better to leave it as a check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of times addEntry, removeEntryForKey, or clear has been called. But since the method can't track that, perhaps it's better to just check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of structural modifications, but without knowing the number, maybe it's better to just check that modCount is non-negative and that it's equal to the number of times it's been incremented. But that's not possible.
