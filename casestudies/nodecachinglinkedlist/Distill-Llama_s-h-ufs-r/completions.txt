Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me first understand what this class does. 

From the code, I see that it's a linked list implementation with a caching mechanism. The idea is that when a node is added, if the cache isn't full, it's added to the cache. If the cache is full, the least recently used node is evicted. The cache size is controlled by a maximum size, which defaults to 20.

So, the key properties I need to check in the representation invariant are:

1. **Cache Size Check**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size. Also, the actual size should be tracked correctly.
2. **No Duplicates in Cache**: Each node in the cache should have a unique value. Wait, no, actually, the cache can have the same value if it's the same node. But in the addNodeToCache method, when a node is added to the cache, it's set to null, but wait, no, the value is set to the new value. Hmm, maybe I need to ensure that each node in the cache has a unique value. Or perhaps not, because the cache can have the same value as long as it's different nodes. Wait, no, because when you add a node, if it's already in the cache, it's just updated. So the cache can have duplicate values if the same value is added multiple times. But the problem is that the cache should not have more nodes than the maximum size. So maybe the main thing is that the cache size is correct.

Wait, looking at the addNodeToCache method: it adds a node to the cache only if the cache isn't full. So the cache size should not exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, when adding a node, it's set to have value null, but that's not correct. Wait, no, in addNodeToCache, the node's value is set to the new value. So the node's value is updated, but the node itself is only added to the cache if there's space.

Another thing: when a node is removed from the linked list, it's added back to the cache. So the cache can have nodes that are not currently in the linked list.

So, for the repOK method, I need to ensure:

- The cache size is not more than maximumCacheSize.
- The actual size of the linked list is correctly tracked.
- When a node is added to the cache, it's correctly linked into the cache, and when it's removed from the linked list, it's added to the cache.

Wait, but the repOK method should verify invariants that are definitely true. So I need to check properties that must hold for the object to be in a valid state.

Let me think about the possible issues:

1. **Cache Size**: The cache size should not exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, the cache size should not be negative.
2. **Linked List Size**: The size of the linked list should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache but still in the linked list. Wait, no, because when a node is removed from the linked list, it's added to the cache. So the linked list size is the total number of nodes minus those in the cache. Or wait, no: the linked list size is the number of nodes in the list, and the cache size is the number of nodes in the cache. But when a node is removed from the list, it's added to the cache. So the linked list size plus the cache size should equal the total number of nodes, but that's not necessarily true because nodes can be in both the list and the cache. Wait, no: when a node is in the cache, it's not in the linked list. Because when you remove a node from the list, you add it to the cache. So the linked list size plus the cache size should equal the total number of nodes, but I'm not sure if that's an invariant.

Alternatively, perhaps the linked list size is equal to the number of nodes that are not in the cache. Because when a node is in the cache, it's not in the linked list. So size = size_of_linked_list + size_of_cache.

Wait, no: when a node is in the cache, it's not in the linked list. So the total number of nodes is size_of_linked_list + size_of_cache.

But the size variable in the class is the total number of nodes. So size should equal the linked list size plus the cache size.

So, in the repOK method, I should check that size == linkedListSize + cacheSize.

Wait, but the linked list size is the actual size, which is tracked by the size variable. Wait, no: the size variable in the class is the total number of nodes. So the linked list size is the number of nodes that are currently in the linked list, which is size - cacheSize.

Wait, no: because when a node is removed from the linked list, it's added to the cache. So the linked list size is the number of nodes that are not in the cache. So linkedListSize = size - cacheSize.

So, in the repOK method, I should check that linkedListSize is equal to size - cacheSize.

But how do I get linkedListSize? Because the linked list's size is tracked by the size variable, but that's the total size, including those in the cache. Wait, no: the size variable is the total number of nodes in the linked list, including those that have been moved to the cache. Because when you remove a node from the linked list, you add it to the cache, but the size variable is incremented when adding a node, and decremented when removing.

Wait, looking at the code:

- addLast() calls addNodeBefore, which adds a new node and increments size.
- remove() calls super_removeNode, which decrements size.

So the size variable is the total number of nodes in the linked list, including those that are in the cache. Wait, no: when a node is removed from the linked list, it's added to the cache, but the size variable is decremented. So the size variable represents the number of nodes in the linked list, not including those in the cache.

Wait, no: when you add a node, size is incremented. When you remove a node, size is decremented. So the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list. The cache size is tracked separately.

So, the total number of nodes is size + cacheSize.

But I'm not sure if that's an invariant. Maybe not, because nodes can be added and removed, but the size variable correctly reflects the linked list size.

So, for the repOK method, I need to check:

1. The cache size is not more than maximumCacheSize.
2. The cache size is not negative.
3. The linked list size is correct, i.e., the size variable equals the number of nodes in the linked list.
4. The cache is correctly linked: each node in the cache has a previous and next node, forming a linked list.

Wait, but the cache is a separate linked list. So the firstCachedNode should point to the next node, and so on, forming a circular buffer.

So, in the repOK method, I should check that the cache forms a valid linked list. That is, each node in the cache has a next and previous node, and the firstCachedNode's next is the second, and so on, until the last node's next is the first.

But that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can check that the cache is a valid linked list by traversing it and ensuring that each node's next and previous are correctly set.

Another thing: when a node is added to the cache, it's set to have value null, but in the addNodeToCache method, the node's value is set to the new value. So the node's value is correctly updated.

Wait, no: in addNodeToCache, the node's value is set to the new value. So the node's value is not null. So perhaps that's not an issue.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should check:

- The cache size is <= maximumCacheSize and >= 0.
- The linked list size is equal to the size variable.
- The cache forms a valid linked list: each node has a previous and next, and the first node's next is the second, etc., and the last node's next is the first.

Wait, but the cache is a separate linked list, so it should be a circular doubly linked list. So the first node's next is the second, and the last node's next is the first.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

1. Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive.
2. Check that the size variable equals the number of nodes in the linked list.
3. Check that the cache forms a valid linked list.

But how to implement step 3?

I can traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode, and check that each node's next is the next node, and the last node's next is the first node.

Also, each node in the cache should have a non-null previous and next, except for the header, but wait, the cache is a separate linked list, so the firstCachedNode should have a previous of null and next of the second node, and so on.

Wait, no: the cache is a linked list, so the first node's previous is null, and the next is the second node. The second node's previous is the first, and next is the third, etc. The last node's next is the first node.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

- If the cache size is greater than 0, check that the firstCachedNode's next is not null, and that the last node's next is the first node.

But how to get the last node? I can traverse the cache until I reach a node whose next is null, which would be the last node.

Alternatively, I can check that the next of the last node is the first node.

So, in code:

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null && current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    // current is the last node
    if (current.next != firstCachedNode) {
        return false;
    }
}

But wait, what if the cache is empty? Then we don't need to check.

Another thing: when a node is added to the cache, it's set to have value null, but in the addNodeToCache method, the node's value is set to the new value. So the node's value is correctly updated.

Wait, no: in addNodeToCache, the node's value is set to the new value, so it's not null. So perhaps that's not an issue.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should:

- Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- Check that the size variable equals the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Check that the cache forms a valid linked list, i.e., each node has a next and previous, and the last node's next is the first.

Wait, but the size variable is the total number of nodes, which is the linked list size plus the cache size. So size == linkedListSize + cacheSize.

But linkedListSize is the number of nodes in the linked list, which is size - cacheSize.

Wait, no: the size variable is the total number of nodes, which is the linked list size plus the cache size. So size = linkedListSize + cacheSize.

So, in the repOK method, I can check that size == linkedListSize + cacheSize.

But how to get linkedListSize? Because linkedListSize is the number of nodes in the linked list, which is the size variable minus the cache size.

Wait, no: the size variable is the total number of nodes, which is the linked list size plus the cache size. So linkedListSize = size - cacheSize.

So, in the repOK method, I can check that linkedListSize is equal to size - cacheSize.

But how to get linkedListSize? Because the linked list's size is tracked by the size variable, but that's the total size including the cache.

Wait, no: the size variable is the total number of nodes in the linked list, including those that have been moved to the cache. Because when you remove a node from the linked list, you add it to the cache, but the size variable is decremented.

So, the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list, not including those in the cache.

Wait, no: when you add a node, size is incremented. When you remove a node, size is decremented. So the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list, regardless of whether they are in the cache or not.

Wait, no: when a node is in the cache, it's not in the linked list. So the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list, and the cache size is the number of nodes in the cache. So the total number of nodes is size + cacheSize.

But the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list, which is the total number of nodes minus the cache size.

So, in the repOK method, I can check that size == (size - cacheSize) + cacheSize, which is always true. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

The size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list. The cache size is the number of nodes in the cache. So the total number of nodes is size + cacheSize.

But the size variable is the number of nodes in the linked list, which is the total number of nodes minus the cache size.

So, size = totalNodes - cacheSize.

But totalNodes = size + cacheSize.

So, size = (size + cacheSize) - cacheSize → size = size. So that's always true.

So, perhaps that's not an invariant to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the size variable should equal the number of nodes in the linked list, which it does, because adding a node increments size, and removing a node decrements size.

So, perhaps the size variable is correct as is.

So, the main things to check are:

1. cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive.
2. The cache forms a valid linked list: each node has a next and previous, and the last node's next is the first.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the cache forms a valid linked list
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
        // Traverse to the last node
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        // Check if last node's next is first node
        if (current == null || current.next != firstCachedNode) {
            return false;
        }
        // Also, check that each node has a previous and next
        // Check first node's previous is null
        if (firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check last node's next is first node
        if (current != null && current.next != firstCachedNode) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check that all nodes have a next and previous
        // But this might be too time-consuming
        // Alternatively, just check that the first and last nodes are correctly linked
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, if the cache has only one node, then current.next is null, and the check current.next != firstCachedNode would be false, but that's okay because the last node's next should be null if the cache size is 1.

Wait, no: if the cache size is 1, the last node's next should be the first node, which is itself. So current.next should be firstCachedNode, which is the same as current.

So, in the code, when cacheSize is 1, current is firstCachedNode, and current.next is null. So current.next != firstCachedNode would be true, which would return false, but that's incorrect.

So, the code needs to handle the case when cacheSize is 1.

So, perhaps the code should be:

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    // Traverse to the last node
    while (current != null && current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    // If cacheSize is 1, current is the last node, which is the same as first
    if (cacheSize == 1) {
        // Check that current.next is null (since it's the last node)
        if (current.next != null) {
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        // Check that last node's next is first node
        if (current.next != firstCachedNode) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    // Also, check that first node's previous is null
    if (firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }
}

This way, when cacheSize is 1, it's allowed, and the last node's next is null, which is correct.

Another thing: each node in the cache should have a non-null next and previous, except for the first node's previous and the last node's next.

Wait, no: in a linked list, each node except the first has a previous, and each node except the last has a next. So in the cache, which is a linked list, each node should have a previous and next, except for the first node's previous (which is null) and the last node's next (which is null if the cache size is 1, or the first node otherwise).

So, in the repOK method, I should also check that each node in the cache has a previous and next, except for the first node's previous and the last node's next.

But checking all nodes might be time-consuming, but perhaps it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the first node's previous is null and the last node's next is either null (if cacheSize is 1) or the first node.

So, in code:

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    // Check first node's previous is null
    if (firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }
    // Find last node
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null && current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }
    // If cacheSize is 1,
