Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class in Java. The invariant should be a method called repOK that checks the internal consistency of the object. Let me think about what properties the HashMap must maintain.

First, I remember that a HashMap is a collection that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash table with buckets, where each bucket can have multiple entries linked by pointers. The main idea is that each key maps to exactly one value, and the hash table allows for efficient lookups.

So, the HashMap has an array called table, which is an array of Entry objects. Each Entry has a key, value, hash, and a next pointer to the next entry in the bucket. The size variable keeps track of the number of key-value pairs. The threshold is used to determine when the table needs to be resized, and the load factor is a measure that determines the capacity when resizing occurs.

The representation invariant should ensure that all these components are consistent. Let me list out the conditions that must hold:

1. The table array should not be null. It's initialized in the constructors, so it should always be an array of Entry objects.

2. The size should be non-negative because it represents the number of elements. It can't be negative.

3. The threshold should be non-negative as well. It's calculated based on capacity and load factor, so it should be >=0.

4. The load factor should be a positive number. It's set in the constructor and can't be zero or negative, as that would cause division issues.

5. The modCount should be non-negative. It's used for tracking structural modifications, so it should be >=0.

6. Each Entry in the table must have a valid hash. The hash is computed when the entry is created, so it should be consistent with the key.

7. For each Entry, the key should not be null unless it's the special NULL_KEY object used internally. Wait, no, the Entry's key can be null because the HashMap allows null keys. Wait, looking back at the code, the maskNull method replaces null keys with a special object, but when the Entry is created, the key is stored as is. So, the Entry's key can be null, but when used in the get method, it's masked. So, the Entry's key can be null.

8. The Entry's next pointer should not form a cycle. Because each Entry is part of a linked list in its bucket, the next pointers should only point to the next Entry or null. So, there should be no cycles, meaning that traversing next pointers shouldn't loop back to a previous Entry.

9. The size should be less than or equal to the capacity of the table. Because each Entry is placed in a bucket, the number of entries can't exceed the number of buckets multiplied by the maximum number of entries per bucket (which is unbounded, but the size is just the count).

Wait, but the size is the number of entries, and the capacity is the number of buckets. So, size can be larger than capacity because multiple entries can be in the same bucket. So, the size can be any non-negative integer, but it's constrained by the capacity and load factor when resizing.

Wait, but the threshold is used to decide when to resize. The threshold is capacity * load factor. So, when size exceeds threshold, the table is resized. So, the size should be <= threshold after any operation, except perhaps during resizing.

Wait, no. The threshold is the value that, when size exceeds it, triggers a resize. So, during a resize, the size might temporarily be larger than the old threshold but then the new threshold is set based on the new capacity.

Hmm, perhaps the invariant is that size must be <= threshold. Because after any operation that adds an entry, if size exceeds threshold, the table is resized. So, in a correctly maintained HashMap, size should never exceed threshold.

Wait, looking at the addEntry method: when a new entry is added, size is incremented, and if it's >= threshold, resize is called. So, after adding, size could be equal to threshold, but then resize would increase the capacity, and the new threshold would be higher.

Wait, no. Let me see: when you add an entry, size is incremented, and if size >= threshold, you resize. So, after resizing, the threshold is set to newCapacity * loadFactor. So, the size after resizing would be less than the new threshold because the new capacity is larger, so the new threshold is higher.

Wait, but during the resize, the size remains the same, but the threshold is updated. So, after resizing, the size is still the same, but the threshold is higher. So, the size could be equal to the old threshold, which was the trigger for resizing, but after resizing, the new threshold is higher.

So, perhaps the invariant is that size <= threshold. Because before resizing, size was >= threshold, but after resizing, the threshold is increased, so size is now <= new threshold.

Wait, but during the resize, the size doesn't change. So, when you call resize, the size is still the same, but the threshold is updated. So, after resize, size is still the same, but the threshold is higher. So, the invariant that size <= threshold would hold because the threshold was just increased.

So, perhaps the invariant is that size <= threshold.

Another point: the modCount should be consistent with the number of structural modifications. But that's more about external consistency (with iterators) rather than internal.

Now, thinking about the Entry objects:

Each Entry's next pointer should not form a cycle. Because each bucket is a linked list, and cycles would cause infinite loops when traversing.

Also, each Entry's hash should be computed correctly from the key. Because the hash is used to determine the bucket index, it's crucial that it's consistent.

Wait, but in the Entry's equals method, it checks both key and value for equality. So, if two Entries have the same key and value, they are considered equal, but their hash codes must be the same. Which they are because the hash is computed from the key, and if the keys are equal, their hash codes are equal.

Wait, no. The Entry's hash is computed as (key == NULL_KEY ? 0 : key.hashCode()) ^ (value == null ? 0 : value.hashCode()). So, the hash is a combination of key and value's hash codes. So, two Entries with the same key but different values would have different hash codes. But in the HashMap, when you put a new value for the same key, it replaces the old one, so the hash remains the same because the key is the same.

Wait, no. When you put a new value, the key is the same, so the hash is the same. So, the Entry's hash is correct.

Another point: the Entry's key, when unmasked, should not be both null and non-null. Wait, no. The maskNull method replaces null keys with a special object, but the Entry's key can be null if the user puts a null key. So, the Entry's key can be null.

Wait, looking at the put method: it masks the key, so if the key is null, it's replaced with NULL_KEY. Then, when creating the Entry, the key is stored as the masked value. So, in the Entry, the key can be NULL_KEY, which represents a null key. So, the Entry's key can be NULL_KEY or any other object.

Wait, no. Let me check the code:

In put, the key is masked: Object k = maskNull(key). Then, the Entry is created with this k. So, if the original key was null, k becomes NULL_KEY. So, the Entry's key is either NULL_KEY or the original key (if not null). So, the Entry's key can't be null; it's either the special NULL_KEY or another object.

Wait, but in the Entry's constructor, the key is stored as is. So, if the original key was null, the Entry's key is NULL_KEY. So, the Entry's key is never null; it's either the special object or another object.

So, in the repOK method, I should check that for each Entry, the key is not null. Because the maskNull ensures that null keys are replaced with NULL_KEY.

Wait, but in the get method, the key is masked as well. So, when looking up, a null key is treated as the special object. So, the Entry's key can't be null; it's either the special object or another object.

So, in the repOK method, I should check that for every Entry in the table, the key is not null. Because the maskNull ensures that any null key is stored as the special object.

Wait, but looking at the Entry's equals method, it uses getKey(), which unmaskNull. So, when comparing keys, it treats the special object as null.

So, in the repOK method, I should ensure that all Entry keys are either the special NULL_KEY or non-null objects.

Wait, but in the Entry's key field, it's stored as the masked value, so it can't be null. So, the key is either the special object or another object, but never null.

So, in the repOK method, I can check that for every Entry, key != null.

Another point: the Entry's next pointer should not point to itself or any previous Entry, which would create a cycle. So, for each Entry, next should not form a cycle.

Wait, but how can I check that in the repOK method? It might be complicated because it would require traversing all linked lists and checking for cycles, which could be time-consuming, but for the purposes of the invariant, perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sufficient to assume that the data structure is correct as per the class's contract, but for the repOK method, we need to enforce the invariants.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should check the following:

1. table is not null.

2. size is non-negative.

3. threshold is non-negative.

4. loadFactor is positive.

5. modCount is non-negative.

6. For each Entry in the table:
   a. key is not null (since it's either the special object or another object).
   b. hash is computed correctly as (key == NULL_KEY ? 0 : key.hashCode()) ^ (value == null ? 0 : value.hashCode()).
   c. next is either null or points to another Entry.

7. For each Entry, the next pointer does not create a cycle in its bucket.

8. size <= threshold.

Wait, but checking for cycles in all linked lists might be too time-consuming, especially for large tables. So, perhaps in the repOK method, it's acceptable to not check for cycles, but that would be a problem because cycles would cause the HashMap to malfunction.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can include a check for cycles, but it's not trivial to implement.

Another point: the Entry's hash should be consistent with the key and value. So, for each Entry, the hash should be equal to (key == NULL_KEY ? 0 : key.hashCode()) ^ (value == null ? 0 : value.hashCode()). But since the Entry's hash is computed this way when created, perhaps it's redundant, but it's still a good check.

So, the repOK method would look something like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check table is not null
    if (table == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check threshold is non-negative
    if (threshold < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check load factor is positive
    if (loadFactor <= 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check modCount is non-negative
    if (modCount < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check each Entry in the table
    for (Entry e : table) {
        if (e != null) {
            // Check key is not null
            if (e.key == null) {
                return false;
            }

            // Check hash is computed correctly
            int computedHash = (e.key == NULL_KEY ? 0 : e.key.hashCode()) ^
                               (e.value == null ? 0 : e.value.hashCode());
            if (e.hash != computedHash) {
                return false;
            }

            // Check next is not forming a cycle (simplified check)
            Entry next = e.next;
            while (next != null) {
                if (next == e) {
                    return false; // Found a cycle
                }
                next = next.next;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check size <= threshold
    if (size > threshold) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but the Entry's key can be the special NULL_KEY, which is an object, so e.key can't be null. So, the check e.key == null would catch any Entry that has a null key, which shouldn't happen because the maskNull ensures that null keys are stored as the special object.

Wait, but in the Entry's key field, it's stored as the masked value, so it can't be null. So, the check e.key == null would always be false, but perhaps it's better to ensure that e.key is not null.
