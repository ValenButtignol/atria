Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. The repOK method should check if the object's state is valid. Let me think about what properties the BinTree must satisfy.

First, the size variable is supposed to represent the number of nodes in the tree. So, I should check that size is non-negative. If it's negative, that's invalid.

Next, the root node's structure must be correct. Each node has left and right children, which should either be null or point to another Node. I need to ensure that the tree doesn't have any cycles, which would cause infinite loops when traversing. So, I'll have to track visited nodes to detect cycles.

I should also verify that each node's left and right children are correctly placed. For example, if a node has a left child, that child's info should be less than the parent's info, and similarly for the right child being greater. Wait, no, actually, in a binary search tree, the left child should be less than the parent, and the right should be greater. But in the given BinTree, the add method seems to be adding nodes in a way that maintains this property. So, the repOK should check that this invariant holds for every node.

Wait, but the add method in BinTree is recursive and seems to correctly place nodes as left or right children based on their value. So, the tree should be a valid BST. Therefore, the repOK should ensure that for every node, all left descendants are less than the node's info, and all right descendants are greater.

Hmm, but checking that for every node might be computationally intensive, especially for large trees. But since the repOK is for ensuring the object's correctness, it's better to be thorough, even if it's slower.

Alternatively, maybe the repOK can just check that the tree structure is correct without necessarily verifying the BST property, but I think the BST property is part of the representation. So, I should include that.

So, the steps for repOK:

1. Check that size is non-negative.
2. Check that the root is either null (if size is 0) or points to a valid node.
3. Traverse the tree to ensure there are no cycles.
4. For each node, ensure that all left children are less than the node's info and all right children are greater.
5. Ensure that the size variable matches the actual number of nodes in the tree.

Wait, how do I check that the size matches the actual node count? I can traverse the tree and count the nodes, then compare with the size variable.

So, putting it all together:

- If size is negative, return false.
- If size is zero, root must be null.
- If root is null but size is not zero, return false.
- Traverse the tree, keeping track of visited nodes to detect cycles.
- For each node, check that left child's info is less than current node's info, and right child's info is greater.
- Count the nodes during traversal and ensure it equals size.

Wait, but in the given BinTree, the add method increments size correctly. So, maybe the size is always correct, but it's better to verify it in repOK.

So, the repOK method will:

- Check size >=0.
- If size is 0, root is null.
- Else, root is not null.
- Traverse each node, ensuring left and right children are valid (i.e., left is less than current, right is greater).
- Also, check for cycles by using a visited set.

Wait, but in Java, how do I traverse the tree without recursion to avoid stack overflows? Maybe using a stack or queue.

Let me outline the code:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
    Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(root);
    int nodeCount = 0;
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = stack.pop();
        if (current == null) {
            continue; // shouldn't happen if tree is correct
        }
        if (visited.contains(current)) {
            return false; // cycle detected
        }
        visited.add(current);
        nodeCount++;
        // Check left and right children
        if (current.left != null) {
            if (current.left.info >= current.info) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.push(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            if (current.right.info <= current.info) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.push(current.right);
        }
    }
    return nodeCount == size;
}

Wait, but in the given BinTree, the add method allows adding the same value again. Because in the add method, it checks if x == current.info and returns. So, duplicates are allowed as siblings. So, the BST property allows equal values in the left or right? Wait, no, in a BST, equal values can be placed in either left or right, but typically, they are placed in one side. But in this case, the add method allows duplicates as siblings.

Wait, looking at the add method:

if (x == current.info) {
    return;
} else if (x < current.info) {
    // add to left
} else {
    // add to right
}

So, if x is equal to current.info, it doesn't add a new node. So, duplicates are not added. So, each node's info is unique. Therefore, in the repOK, we can assume that all nodes have unique values, and the BST property holds strictly: left children are less, right are greater.

So, in the repOK, for each node, if left exists, its info must be less than current's. If right exists, its info must be greater.

So, the code above should work.

But wait, in the code I wrote, when pushing left and right, I check if they are not null, and then check their info against current's. But what if the left child's info is not less than current's? That would violate the BST property.

So, the code correctly returns false in that case.

Also, the nodeCount is incremented for each node visited, and at the end, it's compared to size.

Additionally, the code checks for cycles by using a visited set. If a node is encountered again, it returns false.

So, this should cover all the necessary checks.

Another thing to consider: the root node's info can be any integer, but the left and right children must follow the BST property.

Wait, but in the code, when adding, the root is set correctly. So, the root's info can be any value, but its left and right children must be less and greater, respectively.

So, the code correctly enforces that.

I think this should be a solid repOK method for the BinTree class.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }
    if (size == 0) {
        return root == null;
    }
    if (root == null) {
        return false;
    }
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
    Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(root);
    int nodeCount = 0;
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = stack.pop();
        if (current == null) {
            continue;
        }
        if (visited.contains(current)) {
            return false;
        }
        visited.add(current);
        nodeCount++;
        if (current.left != null) {
            if (current.left.info >= current.info) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.push(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            if (current.right.info <= current.info) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.push(current.right);
        }
    }
    return nodeCount == size;
}
```
