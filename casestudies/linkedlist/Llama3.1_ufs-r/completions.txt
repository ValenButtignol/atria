### Representation Invariant for the LinkedList class

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (header.next == header) {
        return size == 0;
    }

    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.next == current || current.previous == current) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    current = header;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.element == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This representation invariant checks the following properties:

1.  If the list is empty, the `header` node's `next` and `previous` pointers should both point to itself.
2.  For each node in the list, its `next` and `previous` pointers should not point to itself.
3.  For each node in the list, its `element` should not be `null`.

By verifying these properties, we can ensure that the LinkedList class maintains a consistent and valid state.
