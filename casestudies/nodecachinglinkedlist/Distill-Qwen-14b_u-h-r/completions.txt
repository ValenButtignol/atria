Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should return true if the object is valid and false otherwise. Let me look at the class structure and figure out what invariants must hold.

First, the class has several instance variables: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize. I need to ensure that these variables are consistent.

The header is a LinkedListNode that acts as a sentinel. It's initialized in the constructor, and other nodes are added around it. So, the header's previous and next should point to itself, making it a circular structure. That's a key invariant.

The size variable represents the number of elements in the list. Every time a node is added or removed, size is incremented or decremented. So, the size must be non-negative and consistent with the actual number of nodes.

Looking at the cache, the cacheSize should not exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, the firstCachedNode should only be non-null if cacheSize is greater than zero. Additionally, the nodes in the cache should have their next pointers forming a valid linked list, and their previous pointers should be null since they're cached and not part of the main list anymore.

Each node in the main list should have its previous and next pointers correctly set, forming a valid doubly linked list. Also, the header's next should point to the first node, and the last node's next should point back to the header.

Another thing to check is that the createNode method either returns a new node or a cached node. So, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache if there's space. Therefore, the cache should only contain nodes that have been removed and are waiting to be reused.

I should also ensure that the header's previous and next are always itself, as it's a sentinel node.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will check:

1. Header is a valid sentinel node with previous and next pointing to itself.
2. Size is non-negative and consistent with the list structure.
3. Cache size is within bounds (0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize).
4. FirstCachedNode is null if cacheSize is zero.
5. Each node in the main list has correct previous and next pointers.
6. Nodes in the cache form a valid linked list with previous pointers null.

I'll write these checks as conditions in the repOK method, returning true only if all conditions are met.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (header == null) return false;
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) return false;
    if (size < 0) return false;
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) return false;
    if (cacheSize != 0 && firstCachedNode == null) return false;
    
    LinkedListNode currentNode = header.next;
    while (currentNode != header) {
        if (currentNode.getValue() == null) return false;
        if (currentNode.previous == null) return false;
        if (currentNode.next == null) return false;
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    
    currentNode = firstCachedNode;
    while (currentNode != null) {
        if (currentNode.getValue() != null) return false;
        if (currentNode.previous != null) return false;
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
