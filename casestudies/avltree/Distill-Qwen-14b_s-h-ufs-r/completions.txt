Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The repOK method should check if the object's state is valid. Let me think about what properties an AVL tree must satisfy.

First, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Each node must have a height, and the heights must satisfy the AVL tree's balance condition. The balance condition is that the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node can be at most 1. So, for every node, the height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree should be between -1 and 1.

Also, each node must be a binary search tree (BST), meaning that for any node, all nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

So, the repOK method needs to verify these two things: the BST property and the AVL balance condition.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Check if the BST property holds. For every node, all left descendants are less than the node, and all right descendants are greater.

2. Check the AVL balance condition for every node. The height difference between left and right must be <= 1 in absolute value.

Additionally, I should ensure that the tree is properly structured. For example, each node should have a left and right child that are either null or AvlNodes.

Wait, but how do I traverse the tree to check these conditions? I'll need to perform a traversal, perhaps a post-order traversal, to check each node's properties.

Let me think about the structure of the repOK method. It should be a public boolean method. It will return true if all nodes satisfy the BST and AVL conditions, else false.

So, the method will:

- If the tree is empty (root is null), return true since an empty tree is trivially valid.

- Otherwise, traverse each node and check:

   a. For BST: For each node, all left nodes are less than it, and all right nodes are greater.

   b. For AVL: For each node, the height difference between left and right is at most 1.

But how to efficiently check the BST property? One approach is to keep track of the minimum and maximum allowed values as we traverse the tree. For example, when moving left, the maximum allowed value becomes the current node's value. When moving right, the minimum allowed value becomes the current node's value.

Alternatively, for each node, recursively check that all left nodes are less than it and all right nodes are greater. But this might be inefficient for large trees, but for the purposes of a representation invariant, it's acceptable.

Wait, but in the AvlTree class, the nodes are already balanced, so perhaps the tree is always a BST. But the repOK is to ensure that even if some operation messed up the structure, the invariants hold.

So, the repOK method must verify both the BST and AVL properties.

Let me outline the steps in code:

1. Check if the tree is empty. If root is null, return true.

2. For each node, check that it's a BST. So, for a given node, all left descendants are less than it, and all right descendants are greater.

3. For each node, check that the height difference between left and right is <= 1.

But how to implement this? I can write a helper method that traverses the tree and checks these conditions.

Alternatively, I can perform an in-order traversal and check that the elements are in order, which would verify the BST property. But that might not catch all cases, like if a node has a value that's not in the correct position but the in-order traversal still lists them correctly. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Another approach is to perform a recursive check for each node:

- For a given node, check that all left nodes are less than it, and all right nodes are greater.

- Then, check the balance condition.

So, I can write a helper method that takes a node and its min and max values (or perhaps just the parent's value to compare against). Wait, perhaps for the BST check, each node must be greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree. So, for each node, the value must be greater than the maximum value in the left subtree and less than the minimum value in the right subtree.

Wait, that's a stricter condition. Alternatively, each node must be greater than all nodes in its left subtree and less than all nodes in its right subtree. So, for a node, its value must be greater than the maximum value in the left subtree and less than the minimum value in the right subtree.

But checking that for every node might be computationally intensive, but for the repOK, it's necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to check that for each node, all left children are less than it, and all right children are greater. But that doesn't ensure the entire subtree is correct, just the immediate children.

Wait, no. Because if a node's left child is correct, but the left child's right child is not, then the entire tree isn't a BST. So, the helper function needs to recursively check each subtree.

So, the helper function could be something like:

private boolean checkBST(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.element) && checkBST(node.right, node.element, max);
}

But wait, the initial call would need to set min to negative infinity and max to positive infinity. But in Java, we can use Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE.

So, the helper function would start with min = Integer.MIN_VALUE and max = Integer.MAX_VALUE.

But wait, in the case of insertion, the tree is maintained as a BST, but if someone modifies the tree structure externally, the BST property might be violated. So, the repOK must check this.

So, in the repOK method, I can call this helper function starting from the root with min and max as the initial values.

Then, for the AVL condition, I need to check that for every node, the height difference between left and right is at most 1.

But wait, the nodes already have a height field. So, for each node, compute the height of left and right, subtract, and ensure the absolute value is <= 1.

But how to compute the height? Each node has a height field, but after certain operations, the height might not be correctly maintained. So, the repOK must also verify that the height fields are correct.

Wait, that's another point. The height of each node should be one more than the maximum of the heights of its left and right children. So, for each node, height = 1 + max(left.height, right.height). If a node's height doesn't match this, it's invalid.

So, the repOK must also check that each node's height is correctly computed.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method needs to:

1. Check that the tree is a BST.

2. Check that each node's height is correctly computed (height = 1 + max(left.height, right.height)).

3. Check that the tree is balanced according to AVL rules (height difference <= 1 for each node).

So, the steps in code:

- If root is null, return true.

- Check that the tree is a BST by calling the helper function.

- For each node, check that its height is correct.

- For each node, check that the balance condition holds (height difference <= 1).

But how to implement this? I can write a helper method that traverses each node and performs these checks.

Alternatively, I can perform a post-order traversal to compute the height and check the balance.

Wait, perhaps a helper method that for each node returns whether the subtree rooted at that node is valid (BST, height correct, balanced). It can return null or a boolean.

But in Java, it's easier to have a helper method that returns a boolean.

So, let's outline the helper method:

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check BST property
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check left and right subtrees
    boolean leftOK = checkNode(node.left, min, node.element);
    boolean rightOK = checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
    if (!leftOK || !rightOK) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height correctness
    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that current node's height is correct
    int currentHeight = 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != currentHeight) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but the helper function needs to pass the min and max values down. So, perhaps the initial call is checkNode(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE).

But in Java, overloading methods is allowed, so I can have a helper method that takes min and max.

Alternatively, I can write the helper method as:

private boolean checkBST(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.element) && checkBST(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Then, in the repOK method:

if (!checkBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
    return false;
}

Then, check the heights and balance conditions.

Wait, but the height and balance conditions are separate from the BST check. So, perhaps another helper method to check the heights and balance.

Alternatively, combine all checks into one helper method.

Let me think about the structure.

The repOK method will:

- If root is null, return true.

- Else, check that the tree is a BST.

- Check that all nodes have correct heights.

- Check that all nodes are balanced (height difference <= 1).

So, perhaps:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check BST property
    if (!checkBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height correctness and balance
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBST(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.element) && checkBST(node.right, node.element, max);
}

private boolean checkHeightsAndBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;

    // Check balance condition
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height correctness
    int currentHeight = 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != currentHeight) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recurse on children
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(node.left) && checkHeightsAndBalance(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the checkHeightsAndBalance method, for each node, we check the balance and height, and then recursively check the children.

This should cover all nodes.

But wait, what about the root's parent? No, because the root has no parent, so we don't need to check anything beyond that.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will first check if the tree is a BST, then check that all heights are correct and that all nodes are balanced.

But wait, in the AVL tree implementation, the balance is maintained during insertions and deletions. So, the repOK is ensuring that even if something went wrong, the invariants hold.

So, the code for repOK would be as above.

But wait, in the helper methods, I need to make sure that they are correctly implemented.

Another thing to consider: in the AVL tree, the height is maintained correctly. So, the helper method checkHeightsAndBalance ensures that each node's height is one more than the maximum of its children's heights, and that the balance condition is met.

Yes, that should cover it.

So, the final repOK method would look like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check BST property
    if (!checkBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height correctness and balance
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBST(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.element) && checkBST(node.right, node.element, max);
}

private boolean checkHeightsAndBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;

    // Check balance condition
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check height correctness
    int currentHeight = 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != currentHeight) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recurse on children
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(node.left) && checkHeightsAndBalance(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the checkHeightsAndBalance method, for each node, we check the balance and height, and then recursively check the children. This should ensure that all nodes are correctly balanced and have the correct height.

I think this covers all necessary conditions for the AVL tree's representation invariant.
</think>

To ensure the AvlTree class maintains its invariants, the `repOK` method verifies that the tree is a valid AVL tree. This involves checking the binary search tree (BST) property, the correctness of node heights, and the balance condition between left and right subtrees.

### repOK:
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check if the tree is a valid BST
    if (!checkBST(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if all nodes have correct heights and balance
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBST(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBST(node.left, min, node.element) && checkBST(node.right, node.element, max);
}

private boolean checkHeightsAndBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;

    // Check if the balance condition is satisfied
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the current node's height is correctly computed
    int currentHeight = 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != currentHeight) {
        return false;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return checkHeightsAndBalance(node.left) && checkHeightsAndBalance(node.right);
}
```
