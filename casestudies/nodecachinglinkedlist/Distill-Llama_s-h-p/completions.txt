Okay, I need to figure out the representation invariants for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Representation invariants are boolean methods that return true if the object is valid and false otherwise. They should check the consistency of the object's state.

First, I'll look at the class variables. There's header, size, cacheSize, firstCachedNode, and maximumCacheSize. The header is a LinkedListNode, and size is the number of nodes in the list. cacheSize tracks how many nodes are cached, and firstCachedNode is the start of the cached nodes.

The add methods add nodes to the list. The addLast method calls addNodeBefore, which creates a new node and inserts it. The addNode method updates the next and previous pointers and increments size. So, any invariant should check that size is correctly updated.

The remove method removes a node and adds it to the cache. It uses super_removeNode which adjusts the links and decrements size. So, an invariant should ensure size is accurate after removal.

The createNode method tries to get a cached node. If none is available, it creates a new node. Otherwise, it sets the value. So, an invariant should check that the node's value is correctly set when using a cached node.

The addNodeToCache method adds a node to the cache, but only if the cache isn't full. It updates the firstCachedNode and increments cacheSize. An invariant should ensure cacheSize doesn't exceed maximumCacheSize.

The isCacheFull method checks if cacheSize is at maximum. So, an invariant should verify that cacheSize doesn't go beyond maximumCacheSize.

Now, considering each method:

1. addNode: Checks if the node is added correctly and size is incremented. So, an invariant could be hasValidAddNode, which checks if the node's next and previous are correctly set and size is accurate.

2. removeNode: Ensures that the node is properly removed and size is decremented. So, an invariant like hasValidRemoveNode would check the links and size.

3. createNode: Checks if the cached node is used correctly. So, hasValidCreateNode would ensure that if a cached node is used, its value is set.

4. addNodeToCache: Ensures the cache isn't full and the node is added correctly. So, hasValidAddToCache checks cacheSize and the node's links.

5. isCacheFull: Verifies that cacheSize doesn't exceed maximumCacheSize. So, hasValidCacheFull checks this condition.

I need to make sure each invariant is a boolean method returning true if the object is valid. I'll list them as properties with their short descriptions.
</think>

- hasValidAddNode: Checks if a newly added node has correct next and previous pointers and size is incremented.
- hasValidRemoveNode: Ensures a removed node has correct links and size is decremented.
- hasValidCreateNode: Verifies that a cached node's value is set when reused.
- hasValidAddToCache: Ensures the cache isn't full and the node is correctly added.
- hasValidCacheFull: Checks that cacheSize doesn't exceed maximumCacheSize.

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class. The property should check if the object satisfies a certain invariant. The user mentioned that the property is about the representation invariant, specifically "hasValidAddNode", which checks if a newly added node has correct next and previous pointers and that the size is incremented.

First, I'll think about what the invariant entails. When a node is added, it should be linked correctly in the linked list. So, after adding a node, the new node's next and previous pointers should point to the correct nodes. Also, the size of the linked list should have increased by one.

Looking at the code, the `addNode` method is responsible for inserting a new node. It sets the new node's next to the node it's being inserted before, and the new node's previous to the node before that. Then, it updates the size.

So, the property method should verify these conditions. The method will take a `LinkedListNode` as an argument, representing the newly added node. It needs to check:

1. That the new node's next is not null and points to the node it was inserted after.
2. That the new node's previous is not null and points to the node it was inserted before.
3. That the size of the linked list has increased by one.

Wait, but the size is a field, so after adding, the size should be one more than before. However, since the method is checking the state after addition, it can directly check the size.

But how do I get the size? The `size` field is accessible, so after adding, the size should be incremented.

Wait, no. The `addNode` method increments the size. So, after adding, the size should be correct. But in the property method, I need to check that the size has been incremented correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to ensure that after adding, the new node's links are correct and the size is correct.

So, the steps for the property method:

1. Check if the new node's next is not null and equals the node it was added after.
2. Check if the new node's previous is not null and equals the node it was added before.
3. Check if the size has been incremented by one.

Wait, but how do I get the node it was added before? The `addNode` method takes two arguments: the node to insert before and the value. So, in the property, I need to know the node before which the new node was inserted.

Hmm, perhaps the property method needs to be designed with the context of the insertion point. Alternatively, maybe the property is to check that after adding, the new node's next and previous are correctly set, regardless of the specific insertion point.

Wait, the user's description says the property is "hasValidAddNode: Checks if a newly added node has correct next and previous pointers and size is incremented." So, the method should verify that after adding, the new node's next and previous are correctly set, and the size has been incremented.

So, the method signature would be:

public boolean hasValidAddNode(LinkedListNode node)

This method takes the newly added node as an argument and returns true if the node's next and previous are correctly set, and the size has been incremented.

But wait, the size is a field, so after adding, the size should have increased by one. However, in the property method, we can't directly observe the size change because it's a side effect. Alternatively, perhaps the property is to check that the size has been correctly updated.

But in the `addNode` method, the size is incremented. So, in the property, after adding, the size should be one more than before.

Wait, but the property is a boolean method that checks the invariant. So, perhaps the method should ensure that after adding, the new node's next and previous are correctly set, and that the size has been incremented.

So, the steps in the method:

1. Verify that the new node's next is not null and points to the node it was inserted after.
2. Verify that the new node's previous is not null and points to the node it was inserted before.
3. Verify that the size has been incremented by one.

But how do I get the node it was inserted before? The property method only takes the new node as an argument. So, perhaps the method can't directly know where it was inserted. Alternatively, maybe the method can check the links regardless of the insertion point.

Wait, perhaps the method is to check that the new node's next and previous are correctly set, regardless of where it was inserted. So, the method would check that the new node's next is not null and that its previous is not null, and that the size has been incremented.

But in the code, when a node is added, it's inserted between two existing nodes, so the new node's next should point to the node after the insertion point, and the previous should point to the node before the insertion point.

So, in the property method, after adding, the new node's next and previous should be correctly set.

Additionally, the size should have been incremented by one.

So, the method would:

- Check if node.next is not null.
- Check if node.previous is not null.
- Check if size has been incremented.

Wait, but the size is a field, so after adding, the size should be size + 1.

But in the property method, how do I know the size before and after? Because the property is a method that checks the state after the operation.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to check that the new node's links are correct, and that the size has been updated.

But in the code, the size is incremented in `addNode`, so after adding, the size should be correct.

So, the method would:

public boolean hasValidAddNode(LinkedListNode node) {
    // Check if next is not null
    if (node.next == null) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if previous is not null
    if (node.previous == null) {
        return false;
    }
    // Check if size has been incremented
    if (size != sizeBeforeAdd + 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}

Wait, but the method doesn't have access to the size before adding. So, perhaps the method can't check the size increment directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the method can check that the size has been incremented by comparing the current size to the expected size.

But in the property method, the size has already been incremented, so the method can check that the size is correct.

Wait, but the property method is part of the class, and the size is a field. So, after adding, the size should have increased by one.

So, the method can check if size == sizeBeforeAdd + 1. But since the method doesn't have the sizeBeforeAdd, perhaps it's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the property is to check that the new node's next and previous are correctly set, and that the size has been incremented, but without knowing the exact size before, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the property is to check that after adding, the new node's next and previous are correctly set, and that the size has been incremented, but without knowing the exact size before, perhaps it's not possible.

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class. The property should be a boolean method that returns `true` if the object satisfies the property, and `false` otherwise. The property is about the representation invariant, specifically `hasValidRemoveNode`.

First, I should understand what the `removeNode` method does. From the code, `removeNode` is a private method that calls `super_removeNode` and then adds the node back to the cache. The `super_removeNode` method adjusts the links between the previous and next nodes of the removed node and decrements the size.

The invariant `hasValidRemoveNode` should ensure that after removing a node, the links are correctly updated and the size is properly decremented. So, the method needs to check two things: whether the size has been decremented and whether the links are correctly adjusted.

I'll start by checking if the size is correct. The `size` variable is decremented in `super_removeNode`, so after a removal, the size should be one less than before. Then, I'll check the links. The previous node's next should point to the next node, and the next node's previous should point to the previous node. If both conditions are met, the removal was successful.

I should structure the method to perform these checks. It will return `true` if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise `false`.

So, the method will:

1. Capture the current size before any operations.
2. Call `super_removeNode` to remove the node.
3. Check if the size is now one less than before.
4. Check if the previous node's next is the next node and the next node's previous is the previous node.
5. Return `true` if all checks pass, otherwise `false`.

I need to make sure that the method doesn't have any side effects, so it shouldn't modify any internal state beyond what's necessary for the checks. Since it's a boolean property, it's okay to perform these checks each time.

Now, I'll write the method step by step, ensuring that each part correctly verifies the invariant.
</think>

To determine if the `removeNode` operation maintains the correct links and updates the size properly, we can write a method that checks these conditions.

```java
public boolean hasValidRemoveNode() {
    int originalSize = size;
    super_removeNode(new LinkedListNode()); // This is a placeholder for the actual node to be removed
    return size == originalSize - 1 && 
           (header.next != header) && 
           (header.next.previous == header) &&
           (header.next.next != header);
}
```

This method:
1. Captures the original size before removal.
2. Performs a hypothetical removal (using a placeholder node).
3. Checks if the size has been decremented by 1.
4. Verifies that the header's next node is not the header itself.
5. Ensures the header's next node's previous is the header.
6. Checks that the header's next node's next is not the header.

This ensures that the removal operation maintains the correct structure and size.

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class. The property should check if the object satisfies a certain invariant. The user mentioned that the property is about verifying that a cached node's value is set when reused.

Looking at the code, I see that the `createNode` method is used to get or create a cached node. If a cached node is found, it sets its value and returns it. Otherwise, it creates a new node.

So, the invariant here is that whenever a cached node is reused, its value is updated. The method `hasValidCreateNode` should check this.

I'll loop through all the nodes in the linked list. For each node, I'll call `getNodeFromCache()`. If the node is not null, it means it was cached. Then, I'll check if its value is not null. If it's not null, that means the value was set when reused. If I find any node that was cached but still has a null value, the property should return false.

Wait, but `getNodeFromCache()` returns a node only if `cacheSize > 0`. So, I need to ensure that all cached nodes have their values set. Maybe I should iterate through all nodes and check each one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check all the nodes that were added to the cache. But that might be more complex. Instead, checking each node in the linked list might be sufficient because any node that's been reused from the cache should have its value set.

So, the method will iterate through each node starting from the header. For each node, it will try to get it from the cache. If the node is not null, it means it was cached, and its value should not be null. If any such node has a null value, return false. If all are valid, return true.

I should also handle the case where the header itself is a cached node. So, the loop starts from `header.next` and goes through all nodes.

Putting it all together, the method will loop through each node, check if it's cached, and ensure its value is not null. If any fail, return false; else, return true.
</think>

To determine if the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class maintains the invariant that a cached node's value is set when reused, we can implement the following method:

```java
public boolean hasValidCreateNode() {
    for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
        LinkedListNode cachedNode = getNodeFromCache();
        if (cachedNode != null) {
            if (cachedNode.getValue() == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

This method iterates through each node in the linked list and checks if any cached node (retrieved via `getNodeFromCache()`) has a null value, which would indicate that the value was not properly set when the node was reused. If any such node is found, the method returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `hasValidAddToCache` for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class. The method should return `true` if the object satisfies the property, and `false` otherwise. 

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has fields like `header`, `size`, `cacheSize`, and `maximumCacheSize`. The `addNodeToCache` method is private, so I should check what it does. It seems to add a node to the cache, but only if the cache isn't full. So, the property should ensure that when adding a node to the cache, the cache isn't already at its maximum size.

Wait, the property is about adding to the cache. So, the method should check if adding the node is valid. That means the cache shouldn't be full before adding. So, the condition is `cacheSize < maximumCacheSize`. If that's true, then adding is valid.

I should write a method that returns `true` if `cacheSize` is less than `maximumCacheSize`, and `false` otherwise. That makes sense because if the cache is full, we can't add more nodes.

So, the method will simply check `return cacheSize < maximumCacheSize;`. That should cover the invariant that adding to the cache is only done when there's space.

I don't see any other conditions because the `addNodeToCache` method already handles the full case by returning without adding. So, the property is just checking if the cache has space before adding.
</think>

To determine if the cache is not full before adding a new node, the method `hasValidAddToCache` checks if the current cache size is less than the maximum cache size.

```java
public boolean hasValidAddToCache() {
    return cacheSize < maximumCacheSize;
}
```

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method for the NodeCachingLinkedList class that checks if the cache is full. The method should be a boolean property called hasValidCacheFull. 

First, I remember that the cache is managed through the cacheSize and maximumCacheSize variables. The cache is considered full when cacheSize equals or exceeds maximumCacheSize. 

Looking at the existing code, there's a method called isCacheFull() which returns true if cacheSize >= maximumCacheSize. So, I can use that method in my property.

The property method should return true if the cache is not full, meaning it's valid. So, the method would be something like return !isCacheFull(). 

I need to make sure that the method is correctly named and placed in the class. Since it's a property, it should be a public method, but in Java, properties are typically accessed with getters. However, the user specified it as a boolean method, so I'll make it a public boolean method.

Putting it all together, the method will check if the cache is not full and return that result.
</think>

To determine if the cache is valid (not full), the method checks if the current cache size is less than the maximum allowed cache size.

```java
public boolean hasValidCacheFull() {
    return !isCacheFull();
}
```
