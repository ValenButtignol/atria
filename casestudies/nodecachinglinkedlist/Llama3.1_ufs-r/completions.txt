Here's the representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (header.next == header) {
        return size == 0;
    }

    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.next == null || current.next != current.previous) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        LinkedListNode currentCached = firstCachedNode;
        while (currentCached != null) {
            if (currentCached.next == null || currentCached.next != currentCached.previous) {
                return false;
            }
            currentCached = currentCached.next;
        }
    }

    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

This representation invariant checks the following properties:

1.  The header node is the only node that points to itself, and the size of the list is 0.
2.  The linked list is doubly linked, meaning that each node has a reference to its previous and next node.
3.  The cache is a linked list that is separate from the main linked list, and each node in the cache has a reference to its previous and next node.
4.  The cache size does not exceed the maximum cache size.
