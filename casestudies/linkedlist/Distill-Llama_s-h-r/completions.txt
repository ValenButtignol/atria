Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the LinkedList class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I should understand what the LinkedList class does. It has a header and a size. The header is a dummy node that acts as the starting point. The size variable keeps track of the number of elements in the list.

Looking at the methods, add adds an element before a given entry, which is typically the header. The remove method removes an element, either by value or by checking for null elements. The clear method resets the header's next and previous to itself and sets the size to zero. The size method returns the current size.

The Entry class has element, next, and previous fields. The constructor initializes these.

Now, for the representation invariant, I need to check properties that are definitely true for a valid LinkedList. 

I should consider the header. In a valid list, the header's next and previous should point to itself, forming a loop. So, I'll check if header.next is header and header.previous is header.

Next, the size should be consistent. Each add increases the size by one, and each remove decreases it by one. So, the size should equal the number of entries in the list. I can iterate through the list starting from header.next and count the entries until I reach header again. If the count matches the size, it's valid.

Also, each entry should have a non-null next and previous, except for the last and first entries, which point back to the header. Wait, no, in this implementation, the header's next and previous are itself, so all entries should have next and previous pointing correctly. But I need to ensure that all entries are properly linked.

Wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check that the header's next is header and previous is header, and that the size matches the count of entries. Also, ensure that the size is not negative.

So, the steps for repOK would be:

1. Check if header.next is header and header.previous is header.
2. Iterate through the list starting from header.next, counting each entry until we loop back to header.
3. Ensure the count equals the size.
4. Check that size is not negative.

Putting this into code, the repOK method will perform these checks and return false if any condition fails.

To ensure the LinkedList object is in a valid state, the repOK method verifies that the header correctly links to itself, the size matches the number of entries, and the size is non-negative.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header's next and previous are itself
    if (header.next != header || header.previous != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Count the number of entries starting from header.next
    int count = 0;
    for (Entry e = header.next; e != header; e = e.next) {
        count++;
    }

    // Check if the count matches the size and size is non-negative
    if (count != size || size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
