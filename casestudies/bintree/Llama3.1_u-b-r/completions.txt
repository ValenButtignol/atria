Here's the representation invariant for the `BinTree` class as a Java method called `repOK`:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the root is null, in which case the tree is empty
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    }

    // Check if the size of the tree is correct
    return size == countNodes(root);

}

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
    }
}
```

This `repOK` method checks the following conditions:

1.  If the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `null`), then the size of the tree should be 0.
2.  If the tree is not empty, then the size of the tree should be equal to the number of nodes in the tree, which is calculated recursively by the `countNodes` method.

The `countNodes` method is a helper method that recursively counts the number of nodes in the tree by adding 1 for the current node and recursively counting the nodes in its left and right subtrees.

By checking these conditions, the `repOK` method ensures that the representation invariant of the `BinTree` class is maintained.
