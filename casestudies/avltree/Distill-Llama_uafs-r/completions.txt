Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. I remember that a representation invariant is a method that checks whether the current state of the object is consistent with its invariants. It should return false if something is wrong and true otherwise.

Looking at the AvlTree code, it's a balanced binary search tree implementation using rotations and reflections. The key thing here is that the tree should maintain a balance such that the height difference between the left and right subtrees doesn't exceed a certain threshold, which is set by ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

First, I need to think about what the invariant should check. It should verify that the tree is properly balanced according to the rules defined in the balance method. That means checking the heights of the left and right subtrees for each node to ensure they don't differ by more than ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.

I also notice that each node has a height attribute. So, the invariant should traverse the tree, calculate the heights of the left and right subtrees, and ensure that the balance condition is met.

I should start by checking if the root is null. If it is, the tree is empty, which is a valid state. If not, I need to traverse each node and verify the balance.

Wait, but how do I traverse the tree? I can use a recursive approach where for each node, I check its left and right children's heights. If any node violates the balance condition, the invariant should return false.

I should also consider the base case where a node has no children. In that case, its height is -1, which is handled by the height method.

Another thing to think about is the ALLOWED_IMBALANCE constant. It's set to 1, so the height difference between left and right can be at most 1. So, for each node, I need to check if the left height minus right height is greater than ALLOWED_IMBALANCE or vice versa.

I should write a helper method to calculate the height of a subtree. Wait, but the height method is already provided. So, I can use that.

Now, putting it all together, the repOK method will:

1. Check if the root is null. If yes, return true.
2. Otherwise, traverse each node.
3. For each node, check the heights of left and right children.
4. If any node's left and right heights differ by more than ALLOWED_IMBALANCE, return false.
5. If all nodes satisfy the condition, return true.

Wait, but how do I traverse the tree? I can start from the root and recursively check each node's left and right children.

I should also handle the case where a node's left or right child is null. In that case, the height is -1, so the difference would be 0, which is within the allowed imbalance.

Let me outline the steps:

- If the root is null, return true.
- For each node, check if the left child exists. If so, get its height.
- Check if the right child exists. If so, get its height.
- Calculate the difference between left and right heights.
- If the absolute difference exceeds ALLOWED_IMBALANCE, return false.
- Recurse on the left and right children if they exist.
- If any recursion returns false, propagate that up.

Wait, but in the AvlTree, the balance method is called after insertions and deletions. So, the invariant should ensure that the balance method has been applied correctly, maintaining the allowed imbalance.

I think the repOK method should traverse the entire tree, checking each node's balance. If any node violates the balance condition, it returns false.

I should also consider that the tree might have nodes with only one child, which is allowed as long as the imbalance is within the limit.

So, the method will:

- Check if the root is null. If yes, return true.
- For each node, check if the left and right children's heights are balanced.
- If not, return false.
- Otherwise, proceed to check the children recursively.

I think that's the approach. Now, I'll write the code accordingly, making sure to handle null children and correctly calculate the height differences.

To ensure the AvlTree maintains its balance according to the specified rules, the repOK method verifies that each node's left and right subtrees do not exceed the allowed imbalance. Here's the implementation:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }

    return checkBalance(root);
}

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : -1;

    int diff = Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight);
    if (diff > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }

    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Check for an Empty Tree:**
   - If the root is `null`, the tree is empty, and the invariant holds, so return `true`.

2. **Recursive Balance Check:**
   - The helper method `checkBalance` is called starting from the root.
   - For each node, determine the heights of its left and right children. If a child is `null`, its height is considered `-1`.

3. **Imbalance Check:**
   - Calculate the absolute difference between the left and right subtree heights.
   - If this difference exceeds `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE`, the tree is unbalanced, and the method returns `false`.

4. **Recursive Traversal:**
   - Recursively check the balance of the left and right subtrees. If either subtree is unbalanced, the method returns `false`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If all nodes satisfy the balance condition, the method returns `true`, indicating the tree's invariant holds.

This method ensures that the AvlTree adheres to its balancing constraints, maintaining the allowed imbalance for each node's left and right subtrees.
