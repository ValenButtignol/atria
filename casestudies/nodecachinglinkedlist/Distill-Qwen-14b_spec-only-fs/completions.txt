Okay, so I need to write an informal specification for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Let me start by understanding what this class does. From the code, I can see that it's a linked list implementation with some caching mechanism. 

First, I notice that there's a LinkedListNode class inside NodeCachingLinkedList. This inner class represents each node in the linked list. Each node has a previous and next pointer, and a value. The constructor initializes these pointers and the value. There are three constructors: one for null value, one for a given value, and another that takes previous, next, and value.

Now, looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class itself, it has several instance variables: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. The header seems to be the starting point of the linked list. Size keeps track of the number of nodes. The cache variables suggest that the linked list can cache nodes to optimize performance.

The constructor initializes these variables. The header is a new LinkedListNode, size is 0, cacheSize is 0, firstCachedNode is null, and maximumCacheSize is set to 20 by default.

Next, there are methods like remove and add. The remove method takes an object value and removes the first occurrence of that value from the linked list. It throws an IllegalArgumentException if the value is null. The add method adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list and returns true.

Looking deeper, the addLast method is called by add, and it uses addNodeBefore to insert the new node before the header. The createNode method checks if there's a cached node available; if so, it reuses it by setting its value, otherwise, it creates a new node.

The getNodeFromCache method retrieves a node from the cache if available. If the cache is full, it doesn't add new nodes to the cache. The addNodeToCache method adds a node to the cache if there's space.

The LinkedListNode class has methods to get and set the value, previous, and next nodes. It also has three constructors, which is a bit unusual. I wonder why there are three constructorsâ€”maybe for flexibility in creating nodes with different initial states.

I'm trying to understand the overall behavior. It seems like this linked list reuses nodes that have been removed to reduce memory allocation overhead. When a node is removed, it's added to the cache, and when a new node is needed, it takes one from the cache if available.

The methods like addNode, super_removeNode, and others manage the linking of nodes, ensuring that the previous and next pointers are correctly updated when nodes are added or removed.

I'm also noticing that the linked list maintains its size and cache size, ensuring that the cache doesn't exceed its maximum capacity. This is probably to prevent memory issues if the cache grows too large.

One thing I'm not entirely sure about is how the cache interacts with the linked list structure. For example, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache, but how is it later reused? Does it get inserted back into the linked list at the same position, or can it be placed anywhere?

Also, the isEqualValue method checks if two values are equal, considering null cases. This is important to avoid NullPointerExceptions.

I think the key points to include in the specification are:
- The linked list uses a cache to reuse nodes, reducing memory allocation.
- Nodes are cached when removed and reused when new nodes are added.
- The cache has a maximum size to prevent excessive memory usage.
- The linked list maintains its size and cache size.
- The LinkedListNode class represents each node with previous and next pointers and a value.
- Methods like add and remove manage the linked list and cache appropriately.

I should make sure to explain the behavior, attributes, and properties clearly, without going into too much implementation detail. The focus should be on what the class does and how it maintains its state.

### Behavior

The NodeCachingLinkedList class implements a linked list with a caching mechanism to optimize memory usage by reusing nodes that have been removed. It maintains a cache of nodes that can be reused when new nodes are added. The linked list supports adding and removing nodes, and it ensures that the cache does not exceed its maximum capacity. The LinkedListNode inner class represents each node in the linked list, containing a value and pointers to the previous and next nodes.

### Attributes

- header (LinkedListNode): The sentinel node that marks the beginning of the linked list.
- size (int): The number of nodes currently in the linked list.
- DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE (int): The default maximum number of nodes that can be cached.
- firstCachedNode (LinkedListNode): The first node in the cache.
- cacheSize (int): The current number of nodes in the cache.
- maximumCacheSize (int): The maximum number of nodes that can be cached.

The LinkedListNode class has:
- previous (LinkedListNode): Pointer to the previous node.
- next (LinkedListNode): Pointer to the next node.
- value (Object): The data stored in the node.

### Properties

- Node Reuse: Nodes removed from the linked list are added to the cache and can be reused when new nodes are added.
- Cache Management: The cache has a maximum size to prevent excessive memory usage. If the cache is full, new nodes are not added to it.
- Consistent Size: The size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Acyclic Structure: The linked list maintains a proper structure without cycles, ensuring each node has at most one previous and next node.
- Value Comparison: The isEqualValue method ensures that null values are handled correctly and values are compared using the equals method when possible.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check that the size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the cache size is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the header node is consistent
    if (header == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the header's previous and next pointers are consistent
    if (header.previous != null || header.next == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that the linked list is properly linked
    LinkedListNode currentNode = header.next;
    while (currentNode != header) {
        if (currentNode.previous == null || currentNode.next == null) {
            return false;
        }
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }

    // Check that the cache is properly maintained
    LinkedListNode cachedNode = firstCachedNode;
    while (cachedNode != null) {
        if (cachedNode.next != null || cachedNode.previous != null) {
            return false;
        }
        cachedNode = cachedNode.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```
