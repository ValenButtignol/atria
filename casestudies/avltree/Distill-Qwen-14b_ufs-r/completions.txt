Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The repOK method should check that the internal data structures are consistent with the class's invariants. 

First, I remember that an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. So, the invariant should ensure that every node in the tree satisfies this balance condition.

Looking at the AvlTree class, each node has a height attribute. The balance method is supposed to maintain this balance. So, the repOK method needs to verify that for every node, the heights of its left and right children differ by no more than 1.

Wait, but how do I traverse the tree to check each node? I think I'll need a helper method that recursively checks each node's balance. Also, I should ensure that the tree is a valid binary search tree, meaning that for every node, all nodes in the left subtree are less than it, and all nodes in the right subtree are greater.

Hmm, but maybe the repOK method doesn't need to check the BST property if the insert and remove methods are correctly maintaining it. Or does it? Well, the invariant should cover all possible states, so perhaps it's safer to include that check as well.

Wait, but the user's previous examples didn't check the BST property, only structural invariants. For example, in the MinHeap, the repOK checked that each parent is less than its children. So maybe for the AVL tree, the repOK should check the balance condition and the height calculation.

So, the steps I need to take:

1. For every node in the tree, check that the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is at most 1. If any node violates this, return false.

2. Also, ensure that the height of each node is correctly calculated as the maximum height of its children plus one. Because if the height is incorrect, the balance checks might fail.

Wait, but how do I check the height? Because the height is stored in each node, I can compare the node's height with the maximum of its children's heights plus one.

So, for each node, the height should be equal to max(left.height, right.height) + 1. If it's not, that's a problem.

So, the repOK method should:

- Traverse every node in the tree.
- For each node, check that the height is correctly calculated.
- Check that the balance condition (height difference <= 1) is satisfied.

Additionally, I should check that the tree is a valid BST. So, for each node, all left descendants are less than or equal to it, and all right descendants are greater than or equal to it. Wait, but in the case of duplicates, it's usually handled as left <= current <= right. So, for each node, the maximum value in the left subtree should be <= current's value, and the minimum value in the right subtree should be >= current's value.

But checking this for every node might be computationally expensive, but for the purposes of the invariant, it's necessary to ensure the data structure's integrity.

Alternatively, perhaps the BST property is maintained by the insert and remove methods, so maybe it's not necessary to check it in repOK. But I'm not sure. The repOK should cover all possible invariants, so perhaps it's better to include it.

Wait, but the user's previous examples didn't check the BST property. For example, the MinHeap's repOK only checked the heap property, not the structure. So maybe for the AVL tree, the repOK should focus on the balance and height conditions.

So, focusing on the balance and height:

I'll write a helper method that recursively checks each node. The helper will return true if the subtree rooted at the given node satisfies the AVL conditions.

In the helper method:

- If the node is null, return true (base case).
- Check if the absolute difference between left height and right height is more than 1. If so, return false.
- Check if the node's height is equal to max(left height, right height) + 1. If not, return false.
- Recursively check the left and right subtrees.

Wait, but the node's height is already maintained, so perhaps the second check is redundant. Because if the balance method correctly updates the height, then the height should already be correct. But if the height is incorrect, it could cause the balance condition to fail. So, perhaps both checks are necessary.

Alternatively, maybe just checking the balance condition is sufficient because the height is derived from that. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to include both checks.

So, the helper function would look something like this:

private boolean checkBalance(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int leftHeight = node.heightOfLeft();
    int rightHeight = node.heightOfRight();
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    if (node.height != Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBalance(node.left) && checkBalance(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the AvlTree class, each node has a height field. So, for each node, I can get the left and right heights from its left and right children.

Wait, but the node's height is already the max of left and right heights plus one. So, if the node's height is correct, then the balance condition is that the difference between left and right is at most 1.

Wait, no. Because the balance condition is that the difference is at most 1, but the height is the maximum of left and right plus one. So, for example, if left is 3 and right is 2, the difference is 1, which is allowed. The node's height would be 4. But if left is 3 and right is 1, the difference is 2, which is not allowed. So, the helper function needs to check both the balance condition and the height calculation.

Wait, but if the node's height is correctly calculated, then the balance condition is automatically satisfied if the tree is correctly maintained. Or is that the case?

No, because the balance condition is about the difference between left and right heights, not the node's height. So, the helper function needs to check both.

So, in the helper function:

1. For the current node, get the heights of left and right children.

2. Check if the absolute difference is more than 1. If yes, return false.

3. Check if the node's height is equal to max(left, right) + 1. If not, return false.

4. Recurse on left and right children.

So, in the repOK method, I'll call this helper function starting from the root.

Additionally, I should handle the case where the root is null (empty tree), which is valid.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would look like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true; // empty tree is okay
    }
    return checkBalance(root);
}

And then the helper function as described.

Wait, but what about the BST property? Should I check that as well? Because if the tree isn't a BST, then it's not a valid AVL tree. So, perhaps the repOK should also ensure that the tree is a BST.

How can I check that? For each node, all left descendants are <= current node, and all right descendants are >= current node.

But checking this for every node could be time-consuming, but for the purposes of the invariant, it's necessary.

So, I'll need another helper function to check the BST property.

Alternatively, perhaps the insert and remove methods ensure that the tree remains a BST, so the repOK doesn't need to check it. But I'm not sure. The repOK should cover all possible invariants, so perhaps it's better to include it.

So, adding a check for the BST property:

Another helper function:

private boolean isBST(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int min = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    int max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    return isBSTHelper(node, min, max);
}

private boolean isBSTHelper(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element < min || node.element > max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBSTHelper(node.left, min, node.element) && isBSTHelper(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Wait, but in the case of duplicates, the left subtree can have elements equal to the node, and the right can have elements equal as well. So, the helper function should allow equality.

So, the condition should be:

if (node.element < min || node.element > max) {
    return false;
}

But wait, for the left subtree, the maximum allowed is node.element, and for the right subtree, the minimum allowed is node.element.

So, the helper function is correct.

So, in the repOK method, I need to call both checkBalance and isBST.

Wait, but what if the tree is balanced but not a BST? Then it's invalid. So, both checks are necessary.

So, the repOK method would:

- Check if the tree is a BST.
- Check if the tree is balanced according to AVL rules.

So, putting it all together:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return isBST(root) && checkBalance(root);
}

But wait, the helper functions need to be implemented.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper functions can be combined into a single traversal.

But for clarity, it's better to separate them.

So, the complete repOK method would involve these checks.

Wait, but in the given AvlTree class, the nodes are being balanced, so perhaps the BST property is maintained. But to be thorough, the repOK should check it.

So, the steps for the repOK method:

1. If the tree is empty (root is null), return true.

2. Check that the tree is a valid BST.

3. Check that every node satisfies the AVL balance condition.

4. Check that every node's height is correctly calculated as the maximum of its children's heights plus one.

Wait, but step 4 is redundant if step 3 is correctly checking the balance condition, because the balance condition is based on the difference in heights, and the height is the max of left and right plus one.

Wait, no. Because the node's height could be incorrect even if the balance condition is satisfied. For example, if a node's height is set to 3, but its left child has height 2 and right child has height 2. The balance condition is satisfied (difference is 0), but the node's height should be 3, which is correct. So, perhaps step 4 is redundant because the balance condition indirectly ensures that the height is correct.

Wait, no. Because the height is stored in each node, and the balance condition is based on the children's heights. So, if the node's height is not correctly set, the balance condition might not be enforced.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to include both checks.

So, the helper function for balance would:

- For each node, check that the difference between left and right heights is <= 1.

- Check that the node's height is equal to max(left height, right height) + 1.

So, the helper function would return false if either condition is violated.

So, the helper function would be:

private boolean checkBalanceAndHeight(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    int maxHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != maxHeight + 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBalanceAndHeight(node.left) && checkBalanceAndHeight(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the AvlTree class, the height is initialized to 0 for each node. So, for a leaf node, left and right are null, so leftHeight and rightHeight are 0. Then, the node's height should be 1. So, the helper function correctly checks that.

So, in the repOK method:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return isBST(root) && checkBalanceAndHeight(root);
}

But I also need to implement the isBST helper.

Alternatively, perhaps the BST property is maintained by the insert and remove methods, so the repOK doesn't need to check it. But I'm not sure. It's safer to include it.

So, the final repOK method would involve both checks.

Wait, but in the given code, the AvlTree class doesn't have any checks for the BST property in its methods. So, if a node is incorrectly inserted or removed, the tree might not be a BST anymore. Therefore, the repOK should check both the BST property and the AVL balance.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would:

- Check that the tree is a BST.

- Check that every node satisfies the AVL balance condition and correct height.

So, the code would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return isBST(root) && checkBalanceAndHeight(root);
}

And then implement the helper functions.

But wait, the helper functions need to be written as part of the AvlTree class.

So, in the AvlTree class, I'll add:

private boolean isBST(AvlNode node) {
    return isBSTHelper(node, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}

private boolean isBSTHelper(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element < min || node.element > max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBSTHelper(node.left, min, node.element) && isBSTHelper(node.right, node.element, max);
}

And the checkBalanceAndHeight function as before.

Wait, but in the given code, the AvlTree class is in a package, so adding these helper methods is acceptable.

So, the final repOK method would include these checks.

Alternatively, perhaps the BST check is redundant because the insert and remove methods maintain it. But without knowing for sure, it's better to include it.

So, the final repOK method would be as described.

To write the representation invariant for the `AvlTree` class, we need to ensure that the tree maintains both the AVL balance condition and the Binary Search Tree (BST) property. The invariant will check that every node's subtrees have heights differing by at most one and that each node's height is correctly calculated. Additionally, it will verify that the tree adheres to the BST property.

### Approach
1. **BST Property Check**: Ensure that every node's value is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree.
2. **AVL Balance Check**: For each node, the heights of its left and right subtrees must differ by no more than one.
3. **Height Calculation Check**: Each node's height must be equal to the maximum height of its children plus one.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return isBST(root) && checkBalanceAndHeight(root);
}

private boolean isBST(AvlNode node) {
    return isBSTHelper(node, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}

private boolean isBSTHelper(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element < min || node.element > max) {
        return false;
    }
    return isBSTHelper(node.left, min, node.element) && isBSTHelper(node.right, node.element, max);
}

private boolean checkBalanceAndHeight(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int leftHeight = node.left != null ? node.left.height : 0;
    int rightHeight = node.right != null ? node.right.height : 0;
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    int maxHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    if (node.height != maxHeight + 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkBalanceAndHeight(node.left) && checkBalanceAndHeight(node.right);
}
```

### Explanation
- **BST Check**: The `isBSTHelper` method recursively verifies that each node's value falls within the allowed range, ensuring the tree adheres to the BST property.
- **AVL Balance and Height Check**: The `checkBalanceAndHeight` method ensures that each node's subtrees are balanced and that the node's height is correctly calculated. It recursively checks each node to maintain the invariants of an AVL tree.

This approach ensures that the `AvlTree` class maintains both the structural integrity of a BST and the balance condition required for an AVL tree, providing a robust representation invariant.
