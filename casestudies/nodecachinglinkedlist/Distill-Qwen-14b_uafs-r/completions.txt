Okay, so I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. Hmm, I remember that a representation invariant is a condition that must always hold true for the class's data structures. It's like a contract that ensures the object's state is valid.

Looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class, it's a linked list that caches nodes to optimize performance. The class has several private fields: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. There are also methods for adding, removing, and managing the cache.

First, I should understand how this class works. The linked list uses nodes, and when nodes are removed, they are added to a cache. If the cache is full, new nodes aren't cached. The size keeps track of the number of elements, and cacheSize tracks how many nodes are currently cached.

So, the repOK method needs to check that all the invariants are satisfied. Let me think about what these invariants could be.

1. **Consistency between size and cacheSize**: The size of the linked list should be equal to the number of non-cached nodes plus the cached nodes. Wait, no, because cached nodes are still part of the linked list but just stored in the cache for reuse. So, the size should be the total number of nodes in the list, regardless of whether they're cached or not. But the cacheSize is the number of cached nodes. So, the total number of nodes in the list should be equal to the size plus the cacheSize? Or maybe not, because when a node is removed, it's added to the cache, but the size decreases by one. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, looking at the code, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the size of the linked list decreases by one, but the cacheSize increases by one. So, the total number of nodes created should be size + cacheSize. But I'm not sure if that's an invariant. Maybe it's better to check that the size is correct based on the linked list structure.

2. **Linked list structure**: The linked list should be a valid doubly linked list. Each node's previous and next pointers should form a consistent structure without any cycles or inconsistencies. For example, the header's previous should point to itself, and each node's previous and next should correctly link to their neighbors.

3. **Cache management**: The cache should only contain nodes that have been removed from the linked list. Also, the maximum cache size should not be exceeded. So, cacheSize should be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.

4. **Node values**: When a node is in the cache, its value should be null. Because when a node is cached, its value is set to null in the addNodeToCache method. So, any cached node should have a null value.

5. **Header node**: The header node should always be the first node, and its previous should point to itself, and next should point to the first actual node in the list.

6. **Consistency in node references**: Each node's previous and next should not form a cycle, and all nodes should be reachable from the header without causing any loops.

So, putting this together, the repOK method should check all these conditions.

Let me outline the steps the repOK method should perform:

- Check that the header's previous is itself and next is the first node.
- Traverse the linked list from the header to ensure that each node's previous and next pointers are correctly set, forming a valid structure.
- Ensure that the size is consistent with the actual number of nodes in the linked list.
- Verify that the cacheSize does not exceed the maximumCacheSize.
- Check that all cached nodes have a null value.
- Ensure that the number of nodes in the cache plus the size of the linked list equals the total number of nodes created, but I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's better to check that the size is correct based on the linked list structure.

Wait, the size is maintained by the class, so perhaps it's better to ensure that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the linked list. But since the linked list includes both cached and non-cached nodes, maybe the size is always correct. Hmm, perhaps I should focus more on the structural integrity of the linked list and the cache.

Another thing to consider is that the firstCachedNode should only point to nodes that are in the cache, and each cached node's next should point to the next cached node or null.

Also, when a node is in the cache, its value is null, so we can check that any node in the cache has a null value.

So, the repOK method should:

1. Check that the header is correctly initialized.
2. Traverse the linked list to ensure that all nodes are properly linked.
3. Ensure that the size is correct.
4. Check that the cacheSize is within the allowed maximum.
5. Verify that all cached nodes have null values.
6. Ensure that the firstCachedNode is correctly maintained.

I think I should start by writing code that checks each of these conditions.

First, check the header:

if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
    return false;
}

Wait, no. The header's next should point to the first node, and its previous should point to itself. So, initially, header.next is header, but when nodes are added, it changes. So, perhaps the header's previous should always be itself, and next should be the first node in the list.

Wait, looking at the code, the header is a LinkedListNode with previous and next pointing to itself. When nodes are added, they are inserted before the header. So, the header's previous should always point to the last node, and its next should point to the first node.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should write a helper method to traverse the linked list and check each node's previous and next.

Also, I need to make sure that the size is correct. The size is the number of nodes in the linked list, excluding the header. So, when traversing, the number of nodes should match the size.

Another point: when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the cache should only contain nodes that have been removed, and their value is set to null.

So, in the repOK method, I can:

- Check that the header's previous is itself and next is the first node.
- Traverse the list from the header's next node, counting the nodes to ensure the count equals the size.
- For each node, check that previous and next pointers are correctly set, forming a valid linked list without cycles.
- Check that the cacheSize is less than or equal to maximumCacheSize.
- Traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode and ensure that each node's value is null and that they form a valid linked list among themselves.
- Ensure that the total number of nodes (size + cacheSize) does not exceed the maximum possible, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Wait, the maximumCacheSize is a limit on how many nodes can be cached. So, cacheSize should be <= maximumCacheSize.

Also, when a node is in the cache, its value is null, as per the addNodeToCache method, which sets node.setValue(null).

So, in the repOK method, I can:

1. Check that the header's previous is itself and next is the first node.
2. Traverse the main linked list to ensure all nodes are properly linked and count matches size.
3. Check that cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.
4. Traverse the cache to ensure all nodes have null values and are properly linked.
5. Ensure that the size is correct based on the linked list structure.

This seems like a solid plan. Now, I'll try to write the code for each of these checks.

First, check the header:

if (header.getPreviousNode() != header || header.getNextNode() != header) {
    return false;
}

Wait, no. Initially, the header's next is itself, but when nodes are added, the header's next points to the first node. So, perhaps the header's previous should always point to itself, but the next can point to the first node or itself if the list is empty.

Wait, in the constructor, header is initialized with previous and next pointing to itself. So, when the list is empty, header.next is header. When nodes are added, header.next points to the first node.

So, the condition for the header is:

if (header.getPreviousNode() != header || header.getNextNode() != header) {
    return false;
}

Wait, no. Because when the list is empty, header.next is header. But when nodes are added, header.next changes. So, this condition would only be true when the list is empty. But if the list is not empty, header.next is not header. So, this check is only valid when the list is empty. Hmm, perhaps I should handle the empty case separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the header's previous should always point to itself, regardless of the list's state. So, the check should be:

if (header.getPreviousNode() != header) {
    return false;
}

And for the next, it can be anything, depending on whether the list is empty or not.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on the structure of the linked list.

Next, traverse the main linked list:

int count = 0;
LinkedListNode current = header.getNextNode();
while (current != header) {
    count++;
    current = current.getNextNode();
}
if (count != size) {
    return false;
}

This ensures that the size is correct.

Then, check the cache:

if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
    return false;
}

Then, traverse the cache:

int cachedCount = 0;
LinkedListNode cachedCurrent = firstCachedNode;
while (cachedCurrent != null) {
    cachedCount++;
    if (cachedCurrent.getValue() != null) {
        return false;
    }
    cachedCurrent = cachedCurrent.getNextNode();
}
if (cachedCount != cacheSize) {
    return false;
}

Also, ensure that the next of the last cached node is null.

Wait, in the addNodeToCache method, when a node is added to the cache, its next is set to the current firstCachedNode, and its previous is set to null. So, the cache is a linked list where each node's previous is null, and next points to the next cached node.

So, the firstCachedNode is the head of the cache, and each node in the cache has a next that eventually becomes null.

So, in the repOK method, when traversing the cache, we should ensure that each node's previous is null, except for the first node, which has no previous.

Wait, no. The firstCachedNode's previous is set to null when added to the cache. Each subsequent node's previous is set to the previous node.

Wait, looking at the addNodeToCache method:

node.previous = null;
node.next = nextCachedNode;

So, the node being added to the cache has its previous set to null, and next set to the current firstCachedNode.

So, the cache is a linked list where each node's previous is the previous node in the cache, except the first node, which has previous null.

So, in the repOK method, when traversing the cache, each node's previous should point to the previous node in the cache, and the first node's previous should be null.

So, the code for checking the cache would be:

if (firstCachedNode != null) {
    LinkedListNode prev = null;
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (prev != null && current.getPreviousNode() != prev) {
            return false;
        }
        prev = current;
        current = current.getNextNode();
    }
}

This ensures that each node in the cache has its previous correctly set to the previous node.

Also, the next of the last node in the cache should be null.

Another thing to check is that the firstCachedNode is correctly maintained. For example, when a node is removed from the cache, it should be added back to the linked list.

Wait, but the repOK method is supposed to check the invariants, not the behavior of the methods. So, perhaps it's enough to check that the cache is a valid linked list, all nodes have null values, and the size of the cache is correct.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would look something like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.getPreviousNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main linked list size
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.getNextNode();
    while (current != header) {
        count++;
        current = current.getNextNode();
    }
    if (count != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache structure and values
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        int cachedCount = 0;
        LinkedListNode currentCached = firstCachedNode;
        LinkedListNode prevCached = null;
        while (currentCached != null) {
            cachedCount++;
            if (currentCached.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            if (prevCached != null && currentCached.getPreviousNode() != prevCached) {
                return false;
            }
            prevCached = currentCached;
            currentCached = currentCached.getNextNode();
        }
        if (cachedCount != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the code above, when currentCached is not null, we check if its previous is prevCached. But the first node's previous should be null. So, the first iteration should have prevCached as null, and currentCached.getPreviousNode() should be null.

So, the code should be adjusted:

if (prevCached != null && currentCached.getPreviousNode() != prevCached) {
    return false;
}

But for the first node, prevCached is null, so the condition is skipped, and it's okay for currentCached.getPreviousNode() to be null.

Yes, that should work.

Another thing to consider is that the firstCachedNode's previous should be null, and each subsequent node's previous should point to the previous node.

Also, the last node in the cache should have next as null.

In the code above, the loop continues until currentCached is null, so that's handled.

I think this covers all the necessary checks. Now, I should write this as the repOK method.
</think>

To write a representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that the class's data structures and state remain consistent and valid. The invariant will check several conditions related to the linked list structure, cache management, and node values.

### Representation Invariant for `NodeCachingLinkedList`

The `repOK` method will perform the following checks:

1. **Header Node Integrity**: The header node's previous should always point to itself.
2. **Main Linked List Size**: The size of the linked list should match the number of nodes counted from the header.
3. **Cache Size Constraint**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum allowed cache size.
4. **Cache Structure and Values**: Each node in the cache should have a null value, and the cache should form a valid linked list.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header node's previous points to itself
    if (header.getPreviousNode() != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main linked list size consistency
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.getNextNode();
    while (current != header) {
        count++;
        current = current.getNextNode();
    }
    if (count != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size does not exceed maximum
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache structure and node values
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        int cachedCount = 0;
        LinkedListNode currentCached = firstCachedNode;
        LinkedListNode prevCached = null;
        while (currentCached != null) {
            cachedCount++;
            if (currentCached.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            if (prevCached != null && currentCached.getPreviousNode() != prevCached) {
                return false;
            }
            prevCached = currentCached;
            currentCached = currentCached.getNextNode();
        }
        if (cachedCount != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Header Node Integrity**: The header node is a sentinel node that should always point to itself both for previous and next. This ensures the linked list structure is correctly initialized and maintained.

2. **Main Linked List Size**: By traversing from the header's next node and counting the nodes until we return to the header, we ensure that the count matches the `size` variable, which tracks the number of elements in the list.

3. **Cache Size Constraint**: The cache size must not exceed the predefined maximum to prevent memory issues and ensure efficient caching.

4. **Cache Structure and Values**: Each node in the cache should have a null value to indicate it's available for reuse. The cache itself should form a valid linked list where each node's previous pointer correctly references the preceding node in the cache.

This invariant ensures that the `NodeCachingLinkedList` maintains a consistent and valid state, preventing errors and ensuring correct behavior of the data structure.
