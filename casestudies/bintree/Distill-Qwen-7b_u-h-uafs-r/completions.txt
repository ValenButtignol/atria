Alright, I'm trying to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. I'm not entirely sure what a representation invariant is, but from what I remember, it's a condition that must always hold true for the object to be considered valid. So, I need to think about what makes a binary tree valid in this context.

First, I'll look at the BinTree class. It has a private field root, which is of type Node, and a size variable that keeps track of the number of nodes. The add method adds nodes to the tree, and there's a getSize method that returns the size.

I know that in a binary tree, each node can have at most two children: a left and a right. So, for each node, I should check that it doesn't have more than two children. That means, for any given node, its left and right pointers shouldn't both be non-null. If they are, that's invalid.

Also, the size should always be one more than the number of nodes, right? Because size is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 each time a node is added. So, if I have a valid tree, size should equal the number of nodes.

Another thing to consider is that the root should not be null if the tree is not empty. So, if size is greater than 0, root must not be null.

I should also make sure that the tree doesn't have any cycles or loops, but I'm not sure how to check that right now. Maybe it's beyond the scope of a basic representation invariant.

Putting this together, the representation invariant should check:
1. If size is greater than 0, root must not be null.
2. For each node, it shouldn't have both left and right children non-null.
3. The size should be equal to the number of nodes.

I'll write a method called repOK that returns a boolean. It will perform these checks and return false if any condition is violated.

Wait, how do I count the number of nodes? Oh, the size variable already does that. So, I can just compare size with the number of nodes in the tree. But how do I count the number of nodes? I can traverse the tree and count each node, but that might be inefficient. Alternatively, I can keep a separate count variable, but that's not ideal.

Maybe I'll just compare size with the number of nodes by traversing the tree. For each node, I'll increment a counter and check if it equals size.

Also, I need to make sure that each node doesn't have both left and right children. So, for every node, I'll check if both left and right are not null. If they are, that's invalid.

So, the steps for repOK are:
1. If size > 0 and root is null, return false.
2. Traverse the tree, count the number of nodes.
3. If the count doesn't equal size, return false.
4. For each node, check that it doesn't have both left and right children non-null. If any node does, return false.

I think that covers the basic checks. I'll implement this in the repOK method.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size > 0 && root == null) {
        return false;
    }

    int nodeCount = 0;
    Node current = root;

    while (current != null) {
        nodeCount++;
        current = current.left;
    }

    if (nodeCount != size) {
        return false;
    }

    Node current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.left != null && current.right != null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.right;
    }

    return true;
}
```
