Okay, I need to write an informal specification for the AvlTree class in Java. Let me start by understanding what this class does. It's an implementation of an AVL tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree. The key here is that the tree maintains its balance through rotations and ensures that the height is kept as balanced as possible, which leads to efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

Looking at the code, the class has a root node of type AvlNode. The root is initially null, meaning the tree is empty. The class provides methods for inserting, removing, finding the minimum element, checking if the tree is empty, and balancing the tree.

First, I'll list the main attributes. The root is the entry point to the tree. Each node has an element, left and right children, and a height. The height is crucial for maintaining balance.

Next, the methods. The insert method adds a new element to the tree. It uses a recursive helper function that inserts the element and then balances the tree. The remove method also uses a helper function to remove an element and rebalance. The findMin method finds the smallest element by traversing to the leftmost node. The isEmpty method checks if the root is null.

The balance method is critical. It checks if the tree is imbalanced and performs rotations or double rotations to rebalance. The rotations (like rotateWithLeftChild) adjust the tree structure to maintain the AVL property, which allows the tree to remain balanced.

I should also note the constraints. The allowed imbalance is set to 1, meaning the tree can be at most one level taller on either side. This ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced, leading to O(log n) time complexity for operations.

I need to make sure the specification is clear about the behavior of each method, the structure of the nodes, and the balancing mechanism. I'll avoid technical jargon but still be precise enough to capture the essence of the implementation.

Wait, in the remove method, when both left and right children are present, it replaces the node's value with the minimum of the right subtree and then removes that value. That's a standard approach in AVL trees to maintain the structure.

Also, the helper methods like findMin, height, and the rotation functions are private, which makes sense because they're internal to the tree's operations.

I should mention that each node's height is updated after any structural changes to ensure the balance is correctly maintained.

Putting it all together, the specification should outline the class's purpose, its main attributes, the operations it supports, and the constraints that ensure the tree remains balanced. I'll structure it in sections for clarity, making it easy to understand each part without getting bogged down in implementation details.

The `AvlTree` class implements a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) using the AVL tree algorithm. The tree maintains its balance by ensuring the difference in heights between left and right subtrees is at most one. This guarantees logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

### Key Attributes:
- `root`: The root node of the tree. Initially `null` when the tree is empty.
- `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE`: A static constant defining the maximum allowed height difference between left and right subtrees (1).

### Methods:
1. **insert(int x)**:
   - Inserts a new node containing integer `x` into the tree.
   - Maintains tree balance using recursive insertion and balancing.

2. **remove(int x)**:
   - Removes the node containing integer `x` from the tree.
   - Handles cases where the node has zero, one, or two children.
   - Rebalances the tree after removal.

3. **findMin()**:
   - Returns the minimum element in the tree.
   - Throws a `RuntimeException` if the tree is empty.

4. **isEmpty()**:
   - Returns `true` if the tree is empty (`root` is `null`).

5. **balance(AvlNode t)**:
   - Balances the subtree rooted at `t`.
   - Performs rotations or double rotations as needed to maintain the AVL property.

6. **rotateWithLeftChild(AvlNode k2)**:
   - Performs a left rotation on the subtree rooted at `k2`.

7. **rotateWithRightChild(AvlNode k1)**:
   - Performs a right rotation on the subtree rooted at `k1`.

8. **doubleWithLeftChild(AvlNode k3)**:
   - Performs a double left rotation on the subtree rooted at `k3`.

9. **doubleWithRightChild(AvlNode k1)**:
   - Performs a double right rotation on the subtree rooted at `k1`.

### AvlNode Class:
- Represents a node in the AVL tree.
- Contains:
  - `element`: The integer value stored in the node.
  - `left`: Pointer to the left child node.
  - `right`: Pointer to the right child node.
  - `height`: Height of the subtree rooted at this node.

### Constraints:
- The height difference between left and right subtrees of any node is at most `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE` (1).
- Each node's height is updated after any structural changes to maintain balance.
- The tree maintains the BST property, where for every node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's element, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.

<think>
Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The invariant should be a method called repOK that checks the invariants of the tree. Let me think about what these invariants are.

First, the AVL tree is a self-balancing BST. So, for every node, the height difference between the left and right subtrees must be at most ALLOWED_IMBALANCE, which is 1. That's a key invariant.

Also, each node's height must be correctly calculated as the maximum height of its children plus one. So, for any node, height = max(left.height, right.height) + 1. If a node's left or right is null, their height is considered -1, so the calculation should still hold.

Additionally, the tree must maintain the BST property. That means for every node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's element, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.

So, the repOK method needs to check these three things:

1. For every node, the height difference between left and right is <= 1.
2. For every node, its height is correctly computed as max(left.height, right.height) + 1.
3. The BST property holds for every node.

How do I traverse the tree to check these? I can write a helper method that recursively checks each node.

Let me outline the steps:

- If the tree is empty (root is null), then it's trivially correct. So repOK should return true.
- Otherwise, check the root node first.
- For each node, check that the height difference between left and right is <= 1.
- Check that the node's height is correctly calculated.
- Ensure that the left subtree contains only elements less than the node's element, and the right subtree contains elements greater than the node's element.
- Recursively check all left and right subtrees.

Wait, but checking the BST property for every node could be time-consuming, especially for large trees. But for the purposes of the invariant, it's necessary to ensure correctness.

So, the repOK method will perform a traversal of the tree, checking each node for these conditions.

Let me think about possible edge cases:

- A tree with a single node: should satisfy all conditions.
- A tree where a node's left and right heights differ by more than 1: should fail the invariant.
- A tree where a node's height is not correctly computed: should fail.
- A tree where a node has a value in the left subtree that's greater than it, or in the right that's smaller: should fail the BST property.

Now, how to implement this.

I'll create a helper method, maybe called checkNode, which takes an AvlNode and returns a boolean indicating whether the subtree rooted at that node satisfies the invariants.

In checkNode:

1. If the node is null, return true (base case).
2. Check the height difference: Math.abs(height(left) - height(right)) <= ALLOWED_IMBALANCE.
3. Check that the node's height is correct: node.height == Math.max(left.height, right.height) + 1. But wait, if left or right is null, their height is -1. So for a leaf node, left and right are null, so max is -1, +1 gives 0, which is correct.
4. Check the BST property: all elements in left are < node.element, and all in right are > node.element. How? For the left subtree, every node must be less than the current node's element. Similarly for the right.

Wait, but checking every element in the subtree for the BST property could be expensive. But for the invariant, it's necessary. Alternatively, perhaps we can just check that the left child (if exists) is less than current, and the right child (if exists) is greater. But that's not sufficient because the subtrees could have nodes that violate the BST property further down.

Hmm, but to fully check the BST property, we need to ensure that all elements in the left are less than current, and all in the right are greater. So, perhaps for each node, we can check that its left child is less than it, and its right child is greater. But that's not enough because the subtrees could have nodes that violate. So, perhaps the helper function should also check the min and max for each subtree.

Alternatively, perhaps the helper function can track the allowed range for each subtree. For example, when checking the left subtree, all elements must be less than the current node's element, and greater than the lower bound (which could be negative infinity). Similarly, the right subtree must be greater than the current node's element but less than the upper bound (positive infinity).

Wait, that's a standard approach for checking BSTs. So, for each node, we can pass along a min and max value that its value must satisfy. For the left child, the max is the current node's value. For the right child, the min is the current node's value.

So, in the helper function, for a given node, we check:

- node.element > min (or min is -infinity)
- node.element < max (or max is +infinity)
- Then recursively check left child with min unchanged and max set to node.element
- Recursively check right child with min set to node.element and max unchanged

This way, we ensure that every node's value is within the correct range.

Putting it all together, the helper function will:

- For a node, check height constraints.
- Check that node's height is correct.
- Check that node.element is within the allowed range (min, max).
- Recursively check left and right subtrees with updated min and max.

So, the repOK method will call this helper starting with the root, with min as -infinity and max as +infinity.

Now, in Java, how to represent -infinity and +infinity? We can use Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE, but wait, for min, we can set it to null or a special value. Alternatively, use a helper method that takes min and max as parameters.

Wait, perhaps the helper function can be something like:

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    // Check node's element is within (min, max)
    if (node == null) return true;
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) return false;

    // Check height constraints
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) return false;

    // Check node's height is correct
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) return false;

    // Recursively check left and right
    return checkNode(node.left, min, node.element) &&
           checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Wait, but in the initial call, min would be -infinity, which can be represented as Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1 (but that's not possible). Alternatively, we can set min to null and handle it in the method.

Alternatively, perhaps use Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE, but since the elements are integers, maybe it's better to represent min as -infinity and max as +infinity using a special approach.

Wait, perhaps in the helper function, we can pass min as -infinity (like a very small number) and max as +infinity (a very large number). But in Java, we can represent this with Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE, but since the elements are integers, perhaps we can use Integer.MIN_VALUE - 1 as min and Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1 as max, but that's not possible because Integer.MIN_VALUE is the smallest int.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent min as -infinity by using a value lower than any possible integer, like Integer.MIN_VALUE, and max as Integer.MAX_VALUE + 1, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the initial call would have min as -infinity (so any integer is allowed as long as it's less than the root), and max as +infinity.

Wait, perhaps the helper function can be written as:

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node, int min, int max) {
    if (node == null) return true;
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkNode(node.left, min, node.element) &&
           checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Then, in repOK, we call it as:

return checkNode(root, -Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

Wait, but -Integer.MAX_VALUE is the smallest int, so any node's element must be greater than that. Similarly, Integer.MAX_VALUE is the largest, so any node's element must be less than that.

Wait, but in Java, Integer.MIN_VALUE is -2^31 and Integer.MAX_VALUE is 2^31 -1. So, to represent -infinity, perhaps we can use a value lower than Integer.MIN_VALUE, but since int can't hold that, perhaps we can use Long.MIN_VALUE, but that's a long. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a helper method that uses long for min and max.

Alternatively, perhaps we can adjust the helper function to take long min and max.

So, the helper function could be:

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node, long min, long max) {
    if (node == null) return true;
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkNode(node.left, min, node.element) &&
           checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Then, in repOK:

return checkNode(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);

This way, we cover all possible integer values.

Now, putting it all together, the repOK method will:

- If the tree is empty, return true.
- Else, call checkNode on the root with min as Long.MIN_VALUE and max as Long.MAX_VALUE.

Wait, but in the case where the tree is empty, the root is null, so checkNode returns true, which is correct.

So, the repOK method can be written as:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return checkNode(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
}

But wait, in the helper function, when node is null, it returns true, so the initial call to checkNode with root being non-null will proceed.

Now, let me think about possible issues.

What if a node's height is not correctly updated? For example, after some operation, a node's height is incorrect. The helper function will catch that because it compares the node's height with the calculated height.

What about the balancing? If the tree is unbalanced beyond the allowed difference, the helper function will catch it.

What about the BST property? The helper function ensures that each node's value is within the allowed range, which enforces the BST property.

So, this should cover all the necessary invariants.

Now, I need to implement this in the AvlTree class.

Wait, but the helper function is part of the repOK method. So, I'll add the helper method as a private method in the AvlTree class.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will look like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return checkNode(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
}

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node, long min, long max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (node.element <= min || node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkNode(node.left, min, node.element) &&
           checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
}

Wait, but in the helper function, the parameters min and max are of type long, but node.element is an int. Comparing int to long is fine in Java, but perhaps it's better to cast node.element to long for clarity.

Alternatively, perhaps change the helper function to take int min and max, but that's not feasible because we need to represent -infinity and +infinity, which can't be done with int. So, using long is better.

Wait, but in Java, comparing an int to a long is allowed, but perhaps it's better to cast node.element to long.

So, in the helper function, change the condition to:

if ((long) node.element <= min || (long) node.element >= max) {
    return false;
}

But wait, min and max are longs, and node.element is int, so when comparing, Java will promote node.element to long. So, perhaps it's not necessary, but to be safe, perhaps cast it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent min and max as int, but that's not possible because we can't represent -infinity and +infinity with int.

So, using long is the way to go.

Another thing: in the helper function, when node.left or node.right is null, their height is -1. So, when calculating the height difference, it's correctly handled.

Testing the helper function:

Case 1: Tree is empty. repOK returns true.

Case 2: Single node. Check that height difference is 0, height is 0, and element is within the range.

Case 3: A tree where a node's left and right heights differ by 2. The helper function should return false.

Case 4: A tree where a node's height is incorrect. The helper function should return false.

Case 5: A tree where a node has a value in the left subtree that's greater than it. The helper function should return false.

I think this covers the necessary checks.

So, the final repOK method will include these helper functions.
</think>

To ensure the AVL tree maintains its invariants, we need a representation invariant that checks the following properties for every node:
1. The height difference between left and right subtrees is at most `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE` (1).
2. Each node's height is correctly calculated as the maximum height of its children plus one.
3. The tree maintains the BST property, where all elements in the left subtree are less than the node's element, and all elements in the right subtree are greater.

Here is the implementation of the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return checkNode(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
}

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node, long min, long max) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if ((long) node.element <= min || (long) node.element >= max) {
        return false;
    }
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkNode(node.left, min, node.element) &&
           checkNode(node.right, node.element, max);
}
```

This method ensures that all nodes adhere to the AVL tree properties, maintaining the tree's balance and correctness.
