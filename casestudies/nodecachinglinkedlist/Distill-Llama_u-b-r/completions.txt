Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The user mentioned that the method should be called repOK, so I'll focus on creating a method with that name.

First, I should understand what a representation invariant is. From what I remember, it's a condition that must always hold true for the class's data structure. If it doesn't, the class is in an invalid state.

Looking at the NodeCachingLinkedList class, it has several fields: header, size, cacheSize, firstCachedNode, maximumCacheSize, and DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE. The class seems to manage a linked list with a cache for some nodes.

I need to find an invariant that relates these fields. Let's think about the possible invariants.

One thing I notice is the size of the linked list and the cache. The size is the total number of nodes in the list, and cacheSize is how many are cached. The maximumCacheSize is the limit for the cache.

An invariant could be that the number of cached nodes doesn't exceed the maximumCacheSize. So, cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize. That makes sense because if the cache is full, it shouldn't allow adding more nodes.

Another thing is the size of the linked list. The size should be equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache. Wait, but how do we track the nodes not in the cache? Maybe the size is the total, so size = cacheSize + (size - cacheSize). That's always true, but it's more about the relationship between size and cacheSize.

But perhaps a better invariant is that the size of the linked list is always greater than or equal to the cacheSize. Or maybe that the size is equal to the number of nodes in the cache plus the number of nodes not in the cache. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, the maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, which is 20. So, the invariant should probably involve maximumCacheSize and cacheSize.

Let me think about the add and remove operations. When adding a node, if the cache isn't full, it's added to the cache. Otherwise, it's added to the linked list normally. When removing a node, it's added back to the cache if there's space.

So, the invariant should ensure that the cache doesn't exceed its maximum size. That is, cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize. Also, when the cache is full, any new node added should go to the linked list, not the cache.

Another point: the size of the linked list is the total number of nodes. The cacheSize is how many are in the cache. So, size should be at least (cacheSize - (maximumCacheSize - cacheSize)), but that might be too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the invariant is that the number of nodes in the cache is less than or equal to the maximumCacheSize. So, cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

Additionally, when the cache is full, any new node added should not go into the cache. So, when cacheSize == maximumCacheSize, adding a new node should increase the size of the linked list but not the cache.

So, the repOK method should check that cacheSize does not exceed maximumCacheSize. That seems straightforward.

Let me write that as a boolean method. It would return true if the invariant holds, false otherwise.

So, the method would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    return cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize;
}

That seems simple enough. It ensures that the cache isn't over its limit, which is a fundamental invariant.

I should also consider if there are other invariants, but this one seems crucial. For example, if the cache exceeds the maximum size, the class is in an inconsistent state.

I think that's the main invariant here. So, the repOK method will check this condition.
</think>

To ensure the NodeCachingLinkedList class maintains a consistent state, we define the following representation invariant:

**Invariant:** The number of nodes cached does not exceed the maximum allowed cache size.

This invariant ensures that the cache never becomes full beyond its designed capacity, maintaining the integrity of the linked list structure.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    return cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize;
}
```
