Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should check all the invariants that ensure the object is valid. Let me think about what properties this class should maintain.

First, the class uses a linked list with a cache mechanism. The header is a sentinel node. The size variable keeps track of the number of elements. There's also a cache that stores nodes, and the cache has a maximum size.

So, what invariants should I check?

1. The header's previous and next should point to itself. Because in a doubly linked list, each node has previous and next pointers. The header is a special node that acts as a sentinel, so its previous and next should both point to itself. If not, something's wrong.

2. The size should be correct. The size is the number of nodes in the list, excluding the header. So, I need to traverse the list and count the nodes to ensure it matches the size variable.

3. The cache size should not exceed the maximum allowed. The cacheSize variable should be less than or equal to maximumCacheSize. Also, the firstCachedNode should only be non-null if cacheSize is greater than zero.

4. Each node's previous and next pointers should form a valid doubly linked list. There should be no cycles except for the header. So, traversing the list should eventually loop back to the header without any inconsistencies.

5. The cache should only contain nodes that are not part of the active list. Each cached node's value should be null, as per the createNode method which sets the value to null when caching.

6. The firstCachedNode should be the only node in the cache that is linked in a way that it's not part of the main list. So, the next of the firstCachedNode should be the next cached node, and so on, until the end of the cache.

Let me break these down into checks.

First, check the header:
- header.previous should be header.
- header.next should be header.

Next, check the size:
- Traverse the list starting from header.next, counting each node until we loop back to header. The count should equal size.

Then, check the cache:
- If cacheSize is zero, firstCachedNode should be null.
- If cacheSize is greater than zero, firstCachedNode should not be null.
- The maximumCacheSize should be >= cacheSize.
- Each node in the cache should have a value of null.

Also, check that the linked list structure is correct:
- For each node, its previous node's next should point back to it, and its next node's previous should point back to it. This ensures no cycles except the header.

Wait, but checking all that might be too time-consuming. Maybe I can do some partial checks, like ensuring that the header is correct, the size is correct, and the cache is within limits.

Another thing: when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. So, the cache should only contain nodes that have been removed, which have their value set to null.

So, in the repOK method, I'll perform the following checks:

1. Check that the header's previous and next are itself.
2. Check that the size is non-negative and that the list traversal from header.next indeed has size nodes.
3. Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive.
4. Check that if cacheSize > 0, firstCachedNode is not null, and each node in the cache has a null value.
5. Ensure that the linked list structure is correct by verifying that each node's previous and next pointers are consistent.

Wait, but verifying the entire linked list structure could be complex. Maybe I can at least check that the header is correct, and that the size is correct by traversing the list once.

Let me outline the steps:

- Check header's previous and next are itself.
- Traverse the list starting from header.next, count the nodes, and ensure the count equals size.
- Check that cacheSize is <= maximumCacheSize and >=0.
- If cacheSize >0, check firstCachedNode is not null.
- Traverse the cache starting from firstCachedNode, ensuring each node's value is null, and that the next pointers form a valid chain until the end of the cache.
- Ensure that the firstCachedNode's previous is null, as cached nodes shouldn't be part of the main list anymore.

Hmm, but how do I traverse the cache? The cache is a linked list of nodes that are removed. Each node in the cache has its next pointing to the next cached node, and previous pointing to null.

So, starting from firstCachedNode, I can traverse next until I reach null, counting the nodes to ensure it's equal to cacheSize.

Also, each node in the cache should have value null.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks:

1. Check header's previous and next are header.
2. Traverse the main list to count nodes, ensuring count equals size.
3. Check cacheSize is within 0 and maximumCacheSize.
4. If cacheSize >0, check firstCachedNode is not null.
5. Traverse the cache to count nodes and ensure each has value null.
6. Ensure that the main list and cache are disjoint; i.e., no node is in both the main list and the cache.

Wait, that last point is important. A node can't be both in the main list and the cache. So, I need to ensure that when traversing the main list, none of the nodes are in the cache.

But how? Because the cache nodes have their value set to null, but the main list nodes have non-null values. So, during traversal of the main list, if any node's value is null, it might indicate a problem, unless it's the header.

Wait, the header's value is null, but it's a sentinel. So, during traversal, any node except the header with a null value might indicate a problem.

So, in the main list traversal, for each node except the header, check that value is not null.

Wait, but when a node is removed, it's added to the cache with value set to null. So, in the main list, all nodes should have non-null values, except the header.

So, during the main list traversal, for each node after header.next, check that value is not null.

Similarly, in the cache traversal, each node's value should be null.

So, adding that to the checks:

In main list traversal:
- For each node after header, check value != null.

In cache traversal:
- For each node, check value == null.

Also, ensure that the main list and cache don't have overlapping nodes. But since the cache nodes have their value set to null, and the main list nodes have non-null values, this is automatically ensured.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method will:

- Check header's previous and next are header.
- Traverse main list, count nodes, ensure count equals size, and each node's value is not null (except header).
- Check cacheSize is within 0 and maximumCacheSize.
- If cacheSize >0, check firstCachedNode is not null.
- Traverse cache, count nodes, ensure each node's value is null, and that the next pointers are correct.
- Ensure that the main list and cache are correctly separated.

Now, let me think about how to implement each of these checks.

First, check header:

if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) return false;

Then, traverse main list:

int mainSize = 0;
for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
    mainSize++;
    if (node.getValue() == null && node != header) {
        return false;
    }
}
if (mainSize != size) return false;

Then, check cache:

if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) return false;

if (cacheSize > 0) {
    if (firstCachedNode == null) return false;
    // Traverse cache
    int cacheCount = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        cacheCount++;
        if (current.getValue() != null) return false;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (cacheCount != cacheSize) return false;
}

Also, ensure that the firstCachedNode's previous is null, and that the next pointers are correct.

Wait, in the cache, each node's previous should be null, except the first one which has no previous. So, for each node in the cache:

current.previous should be null.

So, during cache traversal:

current = firstCachedNode;
while (current != null) {
    if (current.previous != null) return false;
    current = current.next;
}

Also, check that the next pointers are correct. For each node except the last, next should not be null until the end.

Wait, but in the cache, the next of the last node should be null.

So, during traversal, the next should eventually be null.

I think the above checks are sufficient.

Putting it all together, the repOK method would look like this:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check main list size and values
    int mainSize = 0;
    for (LinkedListNode node = header.next; node != header; node = node.next) {
        mainSize++;
        if (node.getValue() == null && node != header) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    if (mainSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache size constraints
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cache contents if cache is non-empty
    if (cacheSize > 0) {
        if (firstCachedNode == null) {
            return false;
        }

        int cacheCount = 0;
        LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
        while (current != null) {
            cacheCount++;
            if (current.getValue() != null) {
                return false;
            }
            if (current.previous != null) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        if (cacheCount != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Additional checks: ensure that the main list and cache are disjoint
    // Since main list nodes have non-null values and cache nodes have null, this is already covered.

    return true;
}

Wait, but what about the case where a node is both in the main list and the cache? Since the cache nodes have their value set to null, and the main list nodes have non-null values, this can't happen. So, the checks above should cover that.

I think this covers all the necessary invariants. Now, I'll write the repOK method accordingly.

    int mainSize = 0;

            if (current.getValue() != null) {

            }
            if (current.previous != null) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        if (cacheCount != cacheSize) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
