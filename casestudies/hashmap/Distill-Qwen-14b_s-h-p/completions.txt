Okay, so I need to figure out the representation invariants for the Java HashMap class. Representation invariants are boolean methods that check if the object is in a valid state. They should return true if everything is okay and false otherwise.

First, I'll look at the HashMap class provided. It has several instance variables like table, size, threshold, loadFactor, modCount, etc. The class also has various methods for adding, removing, getting entries, resizing, etc.

I remember that a representation invariant typically checks the internal consistency of the data structures. So, for HashMap, I should think about what conditions must always hold true for the object to be considered valid.

1. **Table Initialization**: The table array should never be null. When a HashMap is created, the table is initialized in the constructors. So, a valid HashMap must have a non-null table.

2. **Capacity Constraints**: The initial capacity and maximum capacity have specific constraints. The initial capacity must be a positive number, and the maximum capacity is fixed. So, an invariant could check that the table's length is within these bounds.

3. **Load Factor Check**: The load factor is a float that must be positive and not NaN. The constructors already enforce this, but an invariant could verify that the loadFactor hasn't been altered to an invalid value.

4. **Threshold Validity**: The threshold is calculated based on capacity and load factor. It should never be negative. So, checking that threshold is non-negative would be a good invariant.

5. **Size Consistency**: The size variable keeps track of the number of entries. It should never be negative and should not exceed the maximum capacity. Also, after operations like put or remove, size should be updated correctly.

I think these five points cover the main aspects of the HashMap's internal state. Each of these can be turned into a boolean method that returns true if the condition is met, ensuring the object's validity.
</think>

- TableNotNullInvariant: The table array must not be null.
- CapacityBoundsInvariant: The table's length must be within the valid capacity range.
- LoadFactorInvariant: The load factor must be a positive non-zero value.
- ThresholdNonNegativeInvariant: The threshold must be non-negative.
- SizeConsistencyInvariant: The size must be non-negative and less than or equal to the maximum capacity.

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` that checks if the `table` array in the `HashMap` class is not null. The method should return `true` if the invariant holds and `false` otherwise.

First, I'll look at the `HashMap` class provided. The `table` is a class-level variable of type `Entry[]`. In the constructors, `table` is initialized with `new Entry[capacity]`, so under normal circumstances, it shouldn't be null. However, the invariant should still be checked to ensure that even if something goes wrong, the `table` isn't null.

The method needs to be a boolean method. So, I'll name it `property` and have it return `table != null`. This is straightforward because it directly checks the nullity of the `table` array.

I should also consider if there are any edge cases where `table` could be null. Looking at the constructors, the only place `table` is assigned is within the constructor calls. Since all constructors either call `this(initialCapacity, DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR)` or directly initialize `table`, it's unlikely for `table` to be null unless something unexpected happens, like a constructor being called without initializing `table`. But the invariant method should still check for that possibility.

So, the method will simply return whether `table` is not null. That's the core of the invariant check.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return table != null;
}
```

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` that checks the representation invariant for the HashMap class. The specific invariant here is the CapacityBoundsInvariant, which states that the table's length must be within the valid capacity range. 

First, I should understand what the valid capacity range is. Looking at the HashMap code, I see that the minimum initial capacity is 16 (DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY) and the maximum is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, which is 1 << 30. So the table's length should be at least 16 and at most MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

The method needs to be a boolean method that returns true if the invariant holds and false otherwise. So, I'll name it `capacityBoundsInvariant()`.

In the method, I'll check two conditions: whether the table's length is greater than or equal to the minimum capacity and whether it's less than or equal to the maximum capacity. 

Wait, but what if the table is null? Oh, looking at the constructor, the table is initialized in all cases, so it shouldn't be null. So I don't need to handle that.

So the method will be straightforward. It will access `table.length`, check if it's >= DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY and <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, and return the result of that condition.

I should also make sure that the method is public and static if necessary, but since it's a representation invariant, it's probably an instance method. Wait, no, because the invariant pertains to the instance's table. So it should be an instance method.

Wait, but in the given code, the table is a class-level variable. So each instance has its own table. So the method should be an instance method.

So the method will be:

public boolean capacityBoundsInvariant() {
    int capacity = table.length;
    return capacity >= DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY && capacity <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY;
}

But wait, in the code, the DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY is 16, and MAXIMUM_CAPACITY is 1 << 30. So that's correct.

I think that's all. The method simply checks if the table's length is within the valid range.
</think>

public boolean capacityBoundsInvariant() {
    int capacity = table.length;
    return capacity >= DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY && capacity <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY;
}

Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` that checks the representation invariant for the HashMap class. The specific invariant here is the LoadFactorInvariant, which states that the load factor must be a positive non-zero value.

First, I should understand what the load factor is. From the code, I see that the load factor is stored in the `loadFactor` field of the HashMap class. It's initialized in the constructors, and it's a float. The invariant requires that this value is positive and not zero.

So, the method should return true if `loadFactor` is greater than zero, and false otherwise. That makes sense because a load factor of zero or negative wouldn't make sense for a HashMapâ€”it's used to determine when to resize the table.

Looking at the code, the `loadFactor` is set in the constructors. For example, in the parameterized constructor, it checks if the provided load factor is less than or equal to zero or NaN, throwing an exception if so. Similarly, the default constructor sets it to DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR, which is 0.75f, a positive value.

So, the property method needs to simply check if `loadFactor > 0`. That's straightforward.

I should write a method `public boolean property() { ... }` that returns this condition. Since it's a method of the class, it can directly access the `loadFactor` field.

I don't need to handle any exceptions here because the invariant is supposed to hold based on the class's contract. So, if the load factor is zero or negative, the method should return false, indicating the invariant is violated.

Putting it all together, the method will be a simple boolean check.
</think>

```java
public boolean property() {
    return loadFactor > 0;
}
```

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` that checks if the threshold of a HashMap is non-negative. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the threshold is an instance variable in the HashMap class. So the method should access `this.threshold`.

The method needs to return a boolean. So it's straightforward: return `threshold >= 0`.

I should make sure that the method is public and static if necessary, but since it's a representation invariant, it's probably an instance method. Wait, looking at the code, the HashMap class has a `threshold` field, so the method should be an instance method.

So the method will be `public boolean property() { return threshold >= 0; }`.

I don't need to handle any exceptions here because it's just a simple check. Also, since threshold is an int, checking if it's non-negative is just a matter of comparing it to zero.

I should also consider if there are any edge cases. For example, if the threshold is zero, that's allowed because it's non-negative. The only time it would be a problem is if it's negative, but the constructor ensures that initial capacities are positive, so threshold should never be negative.

So the code is simple: just return whether threshold is greater than or equal to zero.
</think>

public boolean property() {
    return threshold >= 0;
}

<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java method called `property` that checks the SizeConsistencyInvariant for the HashMap class. The invariant states that the size must be non-negative and less than or equal to the maximum capacity.

First, I'll look at the HashMap class provided. The size is an instance variable, and the maximum capacity is a static final variable called MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

So the method should return true if size is >= 0 and size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY. 

I'll start by declaring the method as public boolean property(). 

Inside the method, I'll check if size is less than zero. If it is, return false. Then, check if size exceeds MAXIMUM_CAPACITY. If it does, return false. Otherwise, return true.

Wait, but what about the case when the size is exactly MAXIMUM_CAPACITY? That's allowed, so the condition should be size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

I should also ensure that the method doesn't have any side effects, so it's just a simple check.

So putting it all together, the method will look like:

public boolean property() {
    return size >= 0 && size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY;
}

I think that's all. It's straightforward because it's just checking two conditions.
</think>

public boolean property() {
    return size >= 0 && size <= MAXIMUM_CAPACITY;
}
