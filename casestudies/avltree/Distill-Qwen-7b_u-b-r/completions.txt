Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. Representation invariants are crucial because they define the conditions that must hold true for the data structure to maintain its integrity. Without them, the operations like insert, remove, and balance might not work correctly, leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.

First, I'll look at the AvlTree class. It has a static field ALLOWED_IMBALANCE set to 1. This suggests that the tree allows a certain degree of imbalance between the left and right subtrees. The balance methods in the class use this allowed imbalance to decide when rotations or other balancing operations are needed.

The tree is built using AvlNode objects, which have element, left, right, and height fields. The height is initialized to 0 in the constructor. The height method returns -1 for null nodes, which is a common practice to avoid negative heights in tree calculations.

Looking at the insert and remove methods, they call the balance method after modifying the tree. The balance method adjusts the tree structure using rotations and double rotations to ensure that the height differences between any node's left and right subtrees do not exceed the allowed imbalance of 1.

Now, to write the representation invariant. It should capture the essential properties that must always hold true for the AvlTree to function correctly.

1. **Balance Condition**: The maximum allowed height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is 1. This is enforced by the balance method, which performs rotations when the difference exceeds 1.

2. **Height Calculation**: The height of each node is correctly computed as the maximum height of its children plus one. This is maintained by the height method and is used in the balance method.

3. **Root Node**: The root must not be null unless the tree is empty. This is checked by the isEmpty method, which returns true if root is null.

4. **Consistency of Height**: The height of each node must be consistent with its structure. For example, if a node has a left child with height 3 and a right child with height 2, its height should be 4.

Putting these together, the representation invariant can be stated as:

- The tree is balanced such that the height difference between any node's left and right subtrees does not exceed 1.
- The height of each node accurately reflects the height of its subtree.
- The root node is null if and only if the tree is empty.
- All nodes adhere to the height and balance constraints enforced by the balance method.

This invariant ensures that the AvlTree maintains its balance and structural integrity through all operations, allowing for efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

The representation invariant for the `AvlTree` class ensures that the tree remains balanced and maintains correct node heights. Here's the invariant:

```java
public static void repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        System.out.println("Tree is empty.");
        return;
    }

    // Check the balance condition for the root
    if (Math.abs(height(root.left) - height(root.right)) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        System.out.println("Tree is unbalanced.");
        return;
    }

    // Check each node's height consistency
    checkNodeHeights(root);
}

private static void checkNodeHeights(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return;
    }

    int leftHeight = (node.left == null) ? -1 : height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = (node.right == null) ? -1 : height(node.right);

    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        System.out.println("Node " + node.element + " is unbalanced.");
        return;
    }

    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    checkNodeHeights(node.left);
    checkNodeHeights(node.right);
}
```

This invariant performs the following checks:
1. If the tree is empty (`root == null`), it logs that the tree is empty.
2. It checks the balance condition for the root node. If the height difference between left and right subtrees exceeds `ALLOWED_IMBALANCE` (1), it logs that the tree is unbalanced.
3. It recursively checks each node to ensure their heights are consistent with their structure.

The invariant uses helper methods to verify the tree's balance and node heights, ensuring the `AvlTree` maintains its properties through all operations.
