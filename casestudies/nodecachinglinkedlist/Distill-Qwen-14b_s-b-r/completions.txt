Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The repOK method should check that all the class's invariants are maintained. Let me look at the code and figure out what the invariants are.

First, the class has several instance variables: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, maximumCacheSize. I need to ensure that these variables are consistent and correct.

Looking at the constructor, header is initialized as a new LinkedListNode, size is 0, cacheSize is 0, firstCachedNode is null, and maximumCacheSize is set to DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE which is 20.

Now, thinking about the methods. The add and remove methods modify the linked list and the cache. So the invariants must ensure that after any operation, the state remains consistent.

What are the possible invariants?

1. The header node should always be a sentinel node, meaning its previous and next should point to itself. Because in the constructor, header is created with previous and next as itself. So any changes should not break this.

2. The size variable should correctly represent the number of elements in the list. So whenever elements are added or removed, size should be updated properly.

3. The cache should not exceed maximumCacheSize. So cacheSize should be <= maximumCacheSize.

4. The firstCachedNode should only point to nodes that are in the cache. Also, each cached node's next should point to the next cached node, and their previous should point back, forming a linked list of cached nodes.

5. All nodes in the linked list (excluding the header) should either be in the cache or not. Wait, no, because when a node is removed, it's added to the cache if the cache isn't full. So the linked list nodes can be either in use (part of the list) or cached (available for reuse).

Wait, but the createNode method uses the cache to create new nodes. So when a node is removed, it's added to the cache. When adding a new node, it's taken from the cache if available.

So the invariants should check that the cache is correctly maintained.

Let me think about each possible check:

- Check that header's previous and next are itself. Because in the constructor, header is initialized as a sentinel node pointing to itself. Any operation should not change this.

- Check that size is non-negative and that it correctly reflects the number of elements. So size should be >=0, and when adding or removing, it's correctly incremented or decremented.

- Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize, inclusive. Because you can't have negative cached nodes, and you can't exceed the maximum.

- Check that firstCachedNode is null if cacheSize is 0. Otherwise, firstCachedNode should point to a node, and the linked list of cached nodes should be correctly formed. Each cached node's next should point to the next in the cache, and their previous should point back.

- Also, ensure that any node in the cache has its value set to null. Because when a node is cached, its value is set to null in createNode method. So any cached node should have value == null.

Wait, in the createNode method, when a cached node is reused, its value is set to the new value. So perhaps the invariant is that a node is either in the cache (with value null) or in the list (with value not null). So any node in the list should have a non-null value, and any node in the cache should have a null value.

But wait, when a node is removed, it's added to the cache, and its value is set to null. So yes, cached nodes have null values.

So the invariants would include:

- header.previous == header and header.next == header.

- size >=0.

- 0 <= cacheSize <= maximumCacheSize.

- If firstCachedNode is not null, then it's the first node in the cache, and each subsequent node's previous points to the previous one, forming a linked list.

- All nodes in the cache have value == null.

- All nodes in the linked list (excluding header) have value != null.

Additionally, the linked list structure should be correct. Each node's previous and next should correctly link to form a valid doubly linked list.

But checking all that in repOK might be complicated. Maybe focus on the key invariants that can be easily checked.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should perform several checks:

1. Check that header is a sentinel node: header.previous == header and header.next == header.

2. Check that size is non-negative.

3. Check that cacheSize is between 0 and maximumCacheSize.

4. Check that if firstCachedNode is not null, then cacheSize > 0, and the firstCachedNode's previous is null, and its next points to the next cached node, etc. But traversing the entire cache might be too involved, so perhaps just check that firstCachedNode is null when cacheSize is 0, and that each node in the cache has value null.

Wait, but how do I traverse the cache? Maybe in repOK, I can check that the firstCachedNode is null if cacheSize is 0. If cacheSize >0, then firstCachedNode should not be null, and the node's value should be null.

Also, for each node in the cache, their next should point to the next node in the cache, and their previous should point back.

But that might be too time-consuming for a repOK method, which should be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are:

- header is a sentinel node.

- size is correct.

- cacheSize is within bounds.

- firstCachedNode is null if cacheSize is 0.

- All nodes in the cache have value null.

So, in code:

public boolean repOK() {
    // Check header
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check cacheSize is within bounds
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check firstCachedNode consistency
    if (cacheSize != 0 && firstCachedNode == null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cacheSize == 0 && firstCachedNode != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that all cached nodes have value null
    LinkedListNode currentCachedNode = firstCachedNode;
    while (currentCachedNode != null) {
        if (currentCachedNode.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        currentCachedNode = currentCachedNode.next;
    }

    // Additional checks for linked list structure
    // Maybe check that each node's previous and next are correctly set, but that might be too involved.

    return true;
}

Wait, but in the linked list, each node's previous and next should form a valid structure. For example, for every node except header, node.previous should not be null, and node.next should not be null. But checking that for all nodes might be too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps the main invariants are the ones I listed above, as they cover the key points about the cache and header.

So, the repOK method would include these checks.

To write the representation invariant for the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class, we need to ensure that all internal state variables are consistent and correct. The invariant will be implemented as a method `repOK()` that returns `true` if all invariants hold, and `false` otherwise.

### Approach
The key invariants to check are:
1. **Header Node Integrity**: The header node must always be a sentinel node, meaning its `previous` and `next` pointers must point to itself.
2. **Size Validity**: The `size` of the list must be non-negative.
3. **Cache Size Validity**: The `cacheSize` must be within the bounds of `0` and `maximumCacheSize`.
4. **Consistency of First Cached Node**: If `cacheSize` is greater than `0`, `firstCachedNode` must not be `null`, and if `cacheSize` is `0`, `firstCachedNode` must be `null`.
5. **Cached Node Values**: All nodes in the cache must have their `value` set to `null`.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check that the header is a sentinel node
    if (header.previous != header || header.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that size is non-negative
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that cacheSize is within the valid range
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that firstCachedNode is consistent with cacheSize
    if (cacheSize != 0 && firstCachedNode == null) {
        return false;
    }
    if (cacheSize == 0 && firstCachedNode != null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check that all cached nodes have null values
    LinkedListNode current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.getValue() != null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Header Node Integrity**: The header node is a sentinel node that should always point to itself both in `previous` and `next` references. This ensures the integrity of the linked list structure.
- **Size Validity**: The `size` variable must always be non-negative to represent the number of elements correctly.
- **Cache Size Validity**: The `cacheSize` must not exceed the `maximumCacheSize` and must be non-negative to ensure the cache operates within its limits.
- **Consistency of First Cached Node**: The `firstCachedNode` must align with the `cacheSize`. If the cache is empty (`cacheSize` is `0`), `firstCachedNode` should be `null`, and vice versa.
- **Cached Node Values**: Nodes in the cache should have their `value` set to `null` to indicate they are available for reuse, ensuring no stale data remains in the cache.

This method systematically checks each invariant, ensuring the internal state of the `NodeCachingLinkedList` remains consistent and correct after any operation.
