Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the NodeCachingLinkedList class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. I should only verify properties that I'm completely sure are valid.

First, I'll look at the class structure. The class has several fields: header, size, DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE, firstCachedNode, cacheSize, and maximumCacheSize. The header is a LinkedListNode, and there are other private methods for adding, removing, caching, and creating nodes.

I remember that in a linked list, the header should always point to the first node, and the list should be consistent. So, I should check if the header's next is the first node and that the first node's previous is the header. Also, the size should be equal to the number of nodes, so I'll check if size equals the count of nodes.

Next, the caching mechanism. The cache should not exceed the maximum cache size. So, I'll verify that cacheSize doesn't exceed maximumCacheSize. Also, the firstCachedNode should point to a node that's part of the linked list. I'll check if firstCachedNode is not null and that its next is not null, indicating it's part of the list.

I should also ensure that when a node is added to the cache, it's correctly linked. So, I'll check that firstCachedNode's next is the node being added, and that node's previous is firstCachedNode. This ensures the cache is properly integrated into the linked list.

Additionally, when a node is removed from the cache, it should be correctly detached. I'll check that the node's next is null and that its previous is correctly updated.

I need to make sure that all these checks cover the invariants without introducing any new assumptions. Each check should be based on the class's design and how the nodes are managed.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will perform these checks and return false if any condition fails, ensuring the object's state is valid.

To determine if the `NodeCachingLinkedList` object is in a valid state, we need to verify several key properties:

1. **Header Consistency**: The header node should always be the first node in the list, and the first node should always point back to the header.
2. **Node Count Consistency**: The size of the list should match the count of nodes in the list.
3. **Cache Consistency**: The cache size should not exceed the maximum cache size, and the first cached node should be properly linked within the list.

Here is the `repOK` method implementing these checks:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header's next is the first node and the first node's previous is the header
    if (header.next != header || header.next != firstCachedNode) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the size matches the count of nodes
    if (size != 0) {
        int count = 0;
        LinkedListNode current = header.next;
        while (current != header) {
            count++;
            current = current.next;
        }
        if (count != size) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check if the cache size is within the maximum cache size
    if (cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the first cached node is properly linked
    if (firstCachedNode != null) {
        if (firstCachedNode.next == null || firstCachedNode.next != header.next) {
            return false;
        }
        if (firstCachedNode.previous != null || firstCachedNode.previous != header) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check if the first cached node is properly detached when removed
    if (firstCachedNode != null && firstCachedNode.next == null && firstCachedNode.previous != null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
