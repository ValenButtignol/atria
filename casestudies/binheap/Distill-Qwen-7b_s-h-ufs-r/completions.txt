Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinomialHeap class in Java. Representation invariants are crucial because they ensure that the internal state of the object remains consistent and valid after any operation. So, I should think about what properties must always hold true for a BinomialHeap to be considered valid.

First, I'll look at the structure of the BinomialHeap class. It has a private field called Nodes, which is a BinomialHeapNode, and a size variable. The class has methods like insert, delete, extractMin, and others. The repOK method needs to check these properties.

I remember that a BinomialHeap consists of a collection of Binomial Trees. Each tree has a certain degree, and the heap is structured such that there's exactly one tree of each degree from 0 up to the maximum degree present. So, one of the key properties is that the number of trees with a specific degree should not exceed one.

So, the first check in repOK should ensure that there's only one tree for each degree. I can loop through all possible degrees and make sure that each degree appears at most once.

Next, I should verify that the maximum degree is less than or equal to the logarithm (base 2) of the size plus one. This is because a BinomialHeap of size n can have trees of degrees up to log2(n+1). If the maximum degree exceeds this, the heap isn't properly structured.

Another important aspect is the size of the heap. The size should be equal to the sum of the sizes of all the trees. So, I'll need to calculate the total size by summing the sizes of each tree and ensure it matches the size variable.

Additionally, each tree must be a valid BinomialTree. I should check that each tree satisfies the properties of a BinomialTree, such as having the correct number of nodes for its degree and maintaining the heap property where the key of a node is less than or equal to its children's keys.

I also need to ensure that the root of the heap is not null if the size is greater than zero. This prevents cases where the heap appears empty but actually has trees stored in a different structure.

Putting it all together, the repOK method should perform several checks:
1. Ensure each degree appears at most once.
2. Verify the maximum degree is within the allowed range based on the size.
3. Confirm the total size of all trees equals the size variable.
4. Check that each tree is valid.
5. Ensure the root is not null when the size is positive.

I should write these checks in the repOK method, returning false if any condition fails and true otherwise. This way, whenever the heap is used, it's guaranteed to be in a valid state.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (size == 0 && Nodes == null) {
        return true;
    }

    int maxDegree = 0;
    int numTrees = 0;
    int totalSize = 0;

    // Check each degree appears at most once
    for (int degree = 0; degree <= maxDegree; degree++) {
        if (numTrees >= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        numTrees++;
    }

    // Check maximum degree is within allowed range
    if (maxDegree > Math.log(size + 1) / Math.log(2)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check total size matches
    int sum = 0;
    while (Nodes != null) {
        sum += Nodes.size();
        Nodes = Nodes.sibling;
    }
    if (sum != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check each tree is valid
    while (Nodes != null) {
        BinomialHeapNode tree = Nodes;
        int current = tree;
        int expectedSize = (int) (Math.pow(2, tree.getDegree())) - 1;
        if (current.size() != expectedSize) {
            return false;
        }
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.key > current.child.key) {
                return false;
            }
            current = current.sibling;
        }
        Nodes = Nodes.sibling;
    }

    // Check root is not null when size > 0
    if (size > 0 && Nodes == null) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
