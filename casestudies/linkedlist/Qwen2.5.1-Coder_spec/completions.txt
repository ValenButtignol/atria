- **Attributes:**
  - `header`: A transient `Entry` object serving as the sentinel node for the doubly linked list.
  - `size`: An integer representing the number of elements in the list.

- **Methods:**
  - `add(Object o)`: Adds the specified element to the end of the list. Returns `true`.
  - `remove(Object o)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list. Returns `true` if the element was present, `false` otherwise.
  - `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.

- **Constraints:**
  - The `header` node is a sentinel node and should not be removed.
  - The list is doubly linked, with each `Entry` node having references to its `next` and `previous` nodes.
  - The `size` attribute should always accurately reflect the number of elements in the list.

To ensure the integrity of the `LinkedList` class, we need to define a `repOK` method that checks the following constraints:

1. The `header` node should not be removed.
2. The list should be doubly linked, with each `Entry` node having valid `next` and `previous` references.
3. The `size` attribute should accurately reflect the number of elements in the list.

Here is the `repOK` method for the `LinkedList` class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the header is not null
    if (header == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the header's next and previous references are consistent
    if (header.next == null || header.previous == null) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the header's next and previous references point to each other
    if (header.next.previous != header || header.previous.next != header) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check the size of the list
    int actualSize = 0;
    Entry current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        actualSize++;
        current = current.next;
    }

    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if all entries are properly linked
    current = header.next;
    while (current != header) {
        if (current.next == null || current.previous == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Header Check**: The method first checks if the `header` is not null. If it is, the list is invalid.

2. **Header Consistency Check**: It checks if the `header`'s `next` and `previous` references are not null. This ensures that the header is properly linked to itself.

3. **Header Self-Link Check**: It verifies that the `header`'s `next` and `previous` references point back to the `header`. This is crucial for the sentinel node to function correctly.

4. **Size Check**: It calculates the actual size of the list by traversing from the `header.next` to the `header` and compares it with the `size` attribute. If they do not match, the list is invalid.

5. **Entry Link Check**: It traverses the list from the `header.next` to the `header` and checks that each `Entry` node has valid `next` and `previous` references. This ensures that the list is properly doubly linked.

By implementing this `repOK` method, you can verify that the `LinkedList` class maintains its invariants and behaves as expected.
