```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) {
        return size == 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            Entry next = e.next;
            if (e.hash == e.key.hashCode() && !e.key.equals(e.value)) {
                return false;
            }
            e = next;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
This representation invariant checks that each entry in the table has a key that is equal to its value. If any entry has a key that is not equal to its value, the invariant returns false. If all entries have keys that are equal to their values, the invariant returns true.
