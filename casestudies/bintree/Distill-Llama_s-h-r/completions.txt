Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the BinTree class. The invariant should be a boolean method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I should understand what the BinTree class does. It's a binary tree where each node has a value and left and right children. The add method adds nodes recursively, maintaining the structure. The size is incremented when a new node is added.

So, the invariant should check if the tree is correctly formed. Let's think about the properties that must hold true for the tree to be valid.

1. **Null Checks**: The root should not be null unless the tree is empty. So, if root is null, the size should also be zero. If root is not null, the size must be at least 1.

2. **Consistency of Left and Right Children**: For each node, the left and right children must either both be null or both have valid nodes. If a node has a left child, the right child should not be null, and vice versa.

3. **Ordering of Nodes**: Each node's value must be less than or equal to its parent's value. Wait, no, actually, in a binary search tree, each node's value is greater than all in the left subtree and less than all in the right subtree. But the current add method doesn't enforce this. It just adds nodes in a way that seems to maintain some order, but I'm not sure. Maybe the invariant should check that the tree is a valid binary search tree.

Wait, but the add method doesn't check for the BST property. It just adds nodes in a certain way. So the tree might not be a BST. Therefore, the invariant shouldn't rely on the add method's behavior but should instead ensure the tree's structure is correct.

So, the invariant should check:

- The root is either null or has a valid structure.
- For each node, if it has a left child, the left child's info is less than the node's info.
- Similarly, if it has a right child, the right child's info is greater than the node's info.
- The size is correctly maintained, i.e., the size equals the number of nodes.

Wait, but the size is maintained correctly by the add method, so maybe the invariant doesn't need to check it. Or perhaps it's better to include it to ensure that the size isn't corrupted.

Alternatively, maybe the size is only relevant when the tree is empty or not. So, if root is null, size must be 0. Otherwise, size must be at least 1.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method should:

1. Check if the root is null, then size must be 0.
2. If the root is not null, size must be at least 1.
3. For each node, check that if it has a left child, the left child's info is less than the node's info.
4. Similarly, if it has a right child, the right child's info is greater than the node's info.
5. Ensure that for any node, both left and right children are either both null or both have valid structures.

Wait, but recursively checking every node's left and right children could be computationally intensive, but since it's a method, it's acceptable.

So, the steps in the repOK method would be:

- If root is null, check that size is 0.
- Else, check that size is at least 1.
- Then, recursively check each node to ensure that their left and right children are either both null or both present, and that the values follow the BST property.

Wait, but the tree isn't necessarily a BST because the add method doesn't enforce it. So, the invariant should ensure that the tree is a valid BST.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant should only check structural properties, not the actual values. But the problem says to verify properties we are completely sure are valid. So, if the tree's structure is correct, regardless of the values, then the invariant should check that.

Wait, but the problem says to verify properties that we are completely sure are valid. So, perhaps the invariant should check that the tree is correctly formed, not necessarily that the values are in the right order.

So, the invariant would check:

- The tree is either empty (root is null and size is 0) or not (root is not null and size >=1).
- For each node, if it has a left child, the left child is not null and the right child is null, or both are present and the left's info is less than the node's info and the right's info is greater than the node's info.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Each node can have both left and right children as long as their values are ordered correctly.

So, the invariant should ensure that for each node, if it has a left child, the left child's info is less than the node's info, and if it has a right child, the right child's info is greater than the node's info.

Additionally, for each node, if it has a left child, the left child's right child must be null or have a value greater than the node's info, and similarly for the right child.

Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

For every node in the tree:

- If the node has a left child, the left child's info must be less than the node's info.
- If the node has a right child, the right child's info must be greater than the node's info.
- For any node, if it has a left child, it cannot have a right child unless the right child's info is greater than the node's info and the left child's info is less than the node's info.

Wait, but that's redundant because the left and right children's info are already checked.

So, the repOK method would:

1. Check if root is null, then size must be 0.
2. Else, size must be >=1.
3. For each node, check that if it has a left child, the left child's info < node's info.
4. For each node, check that if it has a right child, the right child's info > node's info.
5. For each node, ensure that if it has both left and right children, the left's info < node's info and right's info > node's info.

Wait, but step 5 is already covered by steps 3 and 4. So, perhaps it's sufficient to check steps 1-4.

Alternatively, perhaps the invariant should ensure that the tree is a valid binary search tree. So, the repOK method would check that for every node, all nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's info, and all nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's info.

But since the add method doesn't enforce this, the tree might not be a BST. So, the invariant needs to check it.

So, the steps would be:

- Check root and size.
- For each node, check that all left descendants have info < node's info.
- For each node, check that all right descendants have info > node's info.

But how to implement this efficiently.

In the repOK method, we can perform a recursive check:

- If the current node is null, return true.
- If the current node has a left child, check that all nodes in the left subtree have info < current node's info.
- Similarly, if the current node has a right child, check that all nodes in the right subtree have info > current node's info.
- Also, check that the left and right children are either both null or both present.

Wait, but the left and right children can't have one null and the other not. For example, a node can't have a left child but no right child unless the left child is the only child.

Wait, no, a node can have only a left child or only a right child. So, the invariant should ensure that if a node has a left child, it doesn't have a right child unless the right child's info is greater than the node's info.

Wait, but that's already covered by checking the values. So, perhaps the invariant doesn't need to check the presence of left and right children beyond ensuring that if a node has a left child, it's info is less than the node's info, and similarly for the right.

So, the repOK method would:

1. Check that if root is null, size is 0.
2. Else, size is >=1.
3. For each node, if it has a left child, the left child's info must be less than the node's info.
4. For each node, if it has a right child, the right child's info must be greater than the node's info.

Additionally, for each node, if it has a left child, the left child's right child must not exist unless it's a valid BST. Wait, no, that's not necessary because the left child's right child can exist as long as its info is greater than the node's info.

Wait, perhaps the invariant doesn't need to check the structure beyond the value relationships. So, the repOK method would:

- Check root and size.
- For each node, ensure that if it has a left child, the left child's info is less than the node's info.
- For each node, ensure that if it has a right child, the right child's info is greater than the node's info.

So, the code would look like:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        if (size < 1) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check each node
        return checkNode(root) && checkChildren(root);
    }

    private boolean checkNode(Node node) {
        if (node.left != null && node.right != null) {
            // Both children exist, so their values must be in order
            return checkNode(node.left) && checkNode(node.right) && node.left.info < node.info && node.right.info > node.info;
        } else if (node.left != null) {
            return checkNode(node.left) && node.left.info < node.info;
        } else if (node.right != null) {
            return checkNode(node.right) && node.right.info > node.info;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }

    private boolean checkChildren(Node node) {
        if (node.left != null && node.right != null) {
            return true;
        } else if (node.left != null || node.right != null) {
            return false; // Only one child exists, which is invalid
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }

Wait, but this might not be correct. Because a node can have only a left child or only a right child. So, the checkChildren method should ensure that if a node has both left and right children, they are both present and their info is in the correct order. But if a node has only one child, it's allowed as long as the child's info is in the correct order.

Wait, no, in a BST, a node can have only a left or only a right child. It can't have both unless the left's info is less than the node's and the right's info is greater than the node's.

Wait, but in the current add method, a node can have both left and right children as long as their info is in the correct order. So, the tree can have nodes with both children.

So, the invariant should allow nodes to have both children as long as their info is correct.

Therefore, the checkChildren method should not return false if a node has only one child. Instead, it should only check that if a node has both children, they are correctly ordered.

Wait, but in a BST, a node can have both children as long as the left is less and the right is greater. So, the invariant should allow that.

So, the checkChildren method should not check for the presence of both children, but rather ensure that if both are present, their info is in order.

So, perhaps the checkChildren method is not needed, and the checkNode method can handle it.

Alternatively, perhaps the checkNode method can be written to ensure that for each node, if it has a left child, the left's info is less, and if it has a right child, the right's info is greater.

So, the repOK method can be structured as:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        if (size < 1) {
            return false;
        }
        return checkNode(root);
    }

    private boolean checkNode(Node node) {
        if (node.left != null) {
            // Left child exists, must be less than node's info
            if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            // Also, check that the left subtree is a valid BST
            return checkNode(node.left) && checkNode(node.right) && checkNode(node.left.right) && checkNode(node.left.left);
        } else if (node.right != null) {
            // Right child exists, must be greater than node's info
            if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            // Check the right subtree
            return checkNode(node.right) && checkNode(node.right.left) && checkNode(node.right.right);
        } else {
            // No children, valid
            return true;
        }
    }

Wait, but this might not cover all cases. For example, if a node has both left and right children, the checkNode method would check the left and right children, ensuring their info is in order.

But perhaps a better approach is to have a helper method that checks the entire tree.

Alternatively, perhaps the repOK method can be written as:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        if (size < 1) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check each node's left and right children
        return checkAllNodes(root);
    }

    private boolean checkAllNodes(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        // Check left child
        if (node.left != null) {
            if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkAllNodes(node.left)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // Check right child
        if (node.right != null) {
            if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkAllNodes(node.right)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

This way, for each node, it checks that the left child (if exists) has info less than the node's info and that the left subtree is valid. Similarly for the right child.

Additionally, the root cannot be null unless size is 0.

So, putting it all together, the repOK method would:

- Check if root is null and size is 0.
- Else, check that size is at least 1.
- Then, recursively check each node to ensure that any left child has info < node's info and any right child has info > node's info.

This ensures that the tree is a valid BST.

So, the final code would be:

public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        if (size < 1) {
            return false;
        }
        return checkAllNodes(root);
    }

    private boolean checkAllNodes(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        // Check left child
        if (node.left != null) {
            if (node.left.info >= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkAllNodes(node.left)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // Check right child
        if (node.right != null) {
            if (node.right.info <= node.info) {
                return false;
            }
            if (!checkAllNodes(node.right)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

But wait, in the current add method, the tree might not be a BST because the add method doesn't enforce the BST property. So, the invariant needs to ensure that the tree is a BST, hence the repOK method must check that.

Yes, that's correct. So, the repOK method must verify that the tree is a valid BST.

Therefore, the code above is appropriate.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to write a representation invariant for the `BinTree` class. The invariant should be a boolean method called `repOK` that returns `true` if the object is valid and `false` otherwise. The invariant must verify that the binary tree is correctly structured and that all nodes adhere to the properties of a valid binary search tree (BST).

### Approach
The approach to solving this problem involves ensuring that the binary tree adheres to the following properties:
1. **Null Checks**: The root should be `null` if and only if the tree is empty (size is 0). If the root is not `null`, the size must be at least 1.
2. **BST Property**: For each node, all nodes in the left subtree must have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in the right subtree must have values greater than the node's value.

The `repOK` method will recursively check each node to ensure that:
- If a node has a left child, the left child's value is less than the node's value.
- If a node has a right child, the right child's value is greater than the node's value.

### Solution Code
```java
package casestudies.bintree;

public class BinTree {
    private Node root;
    private int size = 0;

    public void add(int x) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new Node(x);
            size++;
        } else {
            addRecursive(root, x);
        }
    }

    private void addRecursive(Node current, int x) {
        if (x == current.info) {
            return;
        } else if (x < current.info) {
            if (current.left == null) {
                current.left = new Node(x);
                size++;
            } else {
                addRecursive(current.left, x);
            }
        } else {
            if (current.right == null) {
                current.right = new Node(x);
                size++;
            } else {
                addRecursive(current.right, x);
            }
        }
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return size;
    }

    public static class Node {
        private Node left; 
        private Node right;
        private int info;

        public Node(int info) {
            this.info = info;
        }
    }

    public boolean repOK() {
        if (root
