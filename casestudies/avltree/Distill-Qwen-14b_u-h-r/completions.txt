Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the AvlTree class. The invariant should be a method called repOK that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. 

First, I'll look at the structure of the AvlTree class. It has a root node of type AvlNode, and several methods for inserting, removing, balancing, etc. The AvlNode class has element, left, right, and height fields.

The representation invariant needs to check that all the nodes in the tree satisfy the AVL tree properties. So, for every node, the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees must be at most 1. Also, each node's height should be correctly calculated as the maximum height of its children plus one.

I'll start by checking if the root is null. If it is, the tree is empty, which is valid, so return true.

If the root isn't null, I need to traverse the tree and check each node. I can write a helper method, maybe called checkNode, that takes an AvlNode and returns a boolean indicating if that node and its subtrees are valid.

In the checkNode method, I'll first check if the node's height is correct. The height should be 1 plus the maximum of the heights of the left and right children. If either child is null, their height is considered -1, so the calculation should still work.

Next, I'll check the balance condition. The absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees must be less than or equal to 1. If this isn't true, the tree is unbalanced, so return false.

Then, I'll recursively check the left and right children. If both are valid, the current node is valid.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will call checkNode on the root. If the tree is empty, it's valid. Otherwise, it's valid only if checkNode returns true for the root.

I should also handle the case where the tree might have nodes that violate the AVL properties, so the recursive check is necessary.

Wait, what about the initial state when the tree is empty? The root is null, so repOK should return true because an empty tree is a valid AVL tree.

Another consideration: the height of a node is correctly maintained after each insertion and deletion. So, the invariant should ensure that every node's height is accurate and that the balance condition holds.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the repOK method with these checks.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    return checkNode(root);
}

private boolean checkNode(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check height validity
    int leftHeight = height(node.left);
    int rightHeight = height(node.right);
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > ALLOWED_IMBALANCE) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if height is correctly calculated
    int calculatedHeight = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    if (node.height != calculatedHeight) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Recursively check left and right subtrees
    return checkNode(node.left) && checkNode(node.right);
}
```
