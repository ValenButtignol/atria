Okay, I need to write a representation invariant for the HashMap class. The repOK method should check all the invariants that ensure the object is valid. Let me think about what properties a valid HashMap must have.

First, the HashMap uses an array of Entry objects called table. Each Entry has a key, value, hash, and a next pointer for collision handling. The size variable keeps track of the number of key-value pairs. The threshold is used to determine when to resize the table based on the load factor.

So, the invariants I need to check are:

1. **Capacity Constraints**: The initial capacity must be a power of two and at least 1. Also, the capacity shouldn't exceed MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

2. **Load Factor Check**: The load factor should be within the valid range (greater than 0 and not NaN).

3. **Consistency Between Size and Threshold**: The size should not exceed the threshold, and the threshold should be within the current table's capacity multiplied by the load factor.

4. **No Null Keys or Values**: Since the HashMap uses a special NULL_KEY for null keys, I need to ensure that no Entry has a null key except for the masked NULL_KEY. Also, values can be null, but keys cannot be null except for the special case.

5. **Correct Hashing**: Each Entry's hash should be computed correctly using the hash method provided.

6. **Consistency in Entries**: Each Entry's next pointer should only point to another Entry or be null. Also, each Entry's key and value should not be null unless they are the special NULL_KEY.

7. **Cycle-Free Structure**: The linked list formed by the next pointers in each bucket should not contain cycles to prevent infinite loops during traversal.

8. **Entry Validity**: Each Entry's equals and hashCode methods should behave correctly, ensuring that keys are compared properly and that hash codes are consistent.

Let me break down each of these points and think about how to implement them in the repOK method.

For capacity constraints, I can check if the table's length is a power of two. I can do this by checking if (table.length & (table.length - 1)) == 0. Also, ensure that table.length is at least 1 and doesn't exceed MAXIMUM_CAPACITY.

Next, the load factor should be greater than 0 and not NaN. I can check if loadFactor <= 0 or if it's NaN.

The size should be less than or equal to the threshold, and the threshold should be less than or equal to the current capacity multiplied by the load factor. Also, the threshold should be positive.

For null keys, I need to ensure that no Entry has a key that is null except for the special NULL_KEY. Wait, no, the maskNull method converts null keys to NULL_KEY, so in the table, the key should never be null except for the masked version. So, in each Entry, the key should not be null unless it's the special NULL_KEY.

But looking at the Entry class, the key is stored as an Object, and maskNull converts null to NULL_KEY. So, in the table, the key should never be null except for the special case. So, in the repOK, I need to check that for each Entry, the key is either the special NULL_KEY or not null.

Wait, no. The Entry's key is stored as either the special NULL_KEY or a non-null object. So, in the table, the key should never be null because maskNull converts it. So, in the repOK, I can check that for each Entry, the key is not null unless it's the special NULL_KEY.

But in the Entry class, the key is stored as an Object, and the maskNull method ensures that null keys are converted to the special NULL_KEY. So, in the table, the key should never be null except for the special case. So, in the repOK, I can check that for each Entry, the key is not null unless it's the special NULL_KEY.

Wait, I'm repeating myself. Let me move on.

For the hash, each Entry's hash should be computed using the hash method provided. So, for each Entry, I can recompute the hash of the key and ensure it matches the stored hash.

For the linked list structure, each Entry's next should point to another Entry or null. So, I can traverse each linked list and ensure there are no cycles.

Also, the Entry's equals and hashCode methods should be correct. So, for each Entry, I can check that the equals method behaves as expected and that the hash code is consistent with the key and value.

Putting it all together, the repOK method will have several checks:

1. Check that the table's length is a power of two and within the valid range.

2. Check that the load factor is valid.

3. Check that size <= threshold and threshold <= capacity * loadFactor.

4. Check that all keys are either the special NULL_KEY or non-null.

5. Check that each Entry's hash matches the computed hash of the key.

6. Check that the linked lists in each bucket are cycle-free.

7. Check that each Entry's next is either null or another Entry.

8. Check that the Entry's equals and hashCode methods are correct.

I need to implement each of these checks in the repOK method. Some of these might be complex, like checking for cycles in the linked lists. For that, I can use a visited set and ensure that each Entry is only visited once.

Also, for the hash check, I can compute the hash of the key (using the hash method) and compare it with the Entry's hash.

I should also ensure that the size is non-negative and that the threshold is correctly set.

Another thing to consider is that the Entry's next pointers should not form cycles, which could cause infinite loops during iteration.

So, the repOK method will iterate through each bucket, traverse the linked list, and perform these checks.

I think I've covered all the necessary points. Now, I'll structure the repOK method with these checks.

To write the representation invariant for the `HashMap` class, we need to ensure that the object's state is valid. The `repOK` method will check several invariants, including capacity constraints, load factor validity, consistency between size and threshold, correct hashing, and the integrity of the linked list structure.

Here is the `repOK` method:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    if (table == null) {
        return size == 0 && threshold == 0 && loadFactor == DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR;
    }

    // Check capacity constraints
    int capacity = table.length;
    if (capacity < 1 || capacity > MAXIMUM_CAPACITY || (capacity & (capacity - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check load factor
    if (loadFactor <= 0 || Float.isNaN(loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check size and threshold
    if (size < 0 || threshold < 0 || size > threshold || threshold > capacity * loadFactor) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check entries for null keys and correct hashing
    for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            Object key = e.key;
            Object value = e.value;

            // Check key is not null (except for the special NULL_KEY)
            if (key != NULL_KEY && key == null) {
                return false;
            }

            // Check hash consistency
            int computedHash = hash(maskNull(key));
            if (computedHash != e.hash) {
                return false;
            }

            // Check next pointer
            if (e.next == null) {
                e = null;
            } else if (!(e.next instanceof Entry)) {
                return false;
            } else {
                e = e.next;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for cycles in linked lists
    Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            if (visited.contains(e)) {
                return false; // Cycle detected
            }
            visited.add(e);
            e = e.next;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

This method ensures that the `HashMap` object adheres to all necessary invariants, maintaining its integrity and correctness.
