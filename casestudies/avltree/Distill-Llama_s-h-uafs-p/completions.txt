Okay, so I need to figure out the representation invariants for the AvlTree class. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. Let me start by understanding what an AvlTree is. From what I remember, an AvlTree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It uses rotations to keep the tree balanced, which ensures that each node has a height difference of at most one between its left and right subtrees.

First, I should look at the properties that must always hold true for the tree to be valid. The user mentioned that a representation invariant is a boolean method that returns true if the object is valid and false otherwise. So, I need to identify methods or properties that check for the validity of the AvlTree.

Looking at the code, I see methods like insert, remove, findMin, and balance. These methods modify the tree, so they should ensure that the tree remains balanced and adheres to the AvlTree properties.

One obvious invariant is that the tree must be balanced. So, the balance method is crucial here. It should ensure that the height difference between the left and right subtrees doesn't exceed the allowed imbalance, which is set to 1 in this case.

Another thing to consider is the structure of the tree. Each node should have at most two children, and the tree should be a binary search tree, meaning that for any node, all left descendants are less than or equal to it, and all right descendants are greater than or equal to it. But since the AvlTree is self-balancing, the structure is maintained through rotations, so maybe that's already covered.

I also notice that each node has a height attribute. The height is the number of edges on the longest downward path from the node to a leaf. So, the height calculation must be consistent across the tree.

Wait, but how do I translate these into properties? Maybe I should think about what could go wrong. For example, if after an insert or remove operation, the tree becomes unbalanced beyond the allowed limit, that's a problem. So, the balance method should always return a balanced tree.

Also, the tree should maintain the BST property, meaning that for every node, its left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than or equal to the node's value. But since the AvlTree is a BST, this should always hold true.

Another point is that the tree should not have any cycles, as it's a tree structure. Each node should have at most two children, and there should be no back edges that would create cycles.

Additionally, the size of the tree should be consistent. After any operation, the size should reflect the actual number of nodes in the tree. So, if the size is incremented during an insert and decremented during a remove, that should always hold.

Wait, but the user mentioned not to include more than five properties. So, I need to narrow it down. Let me list what I have so far:

1. Balanced Structure: The tree must be balanced according to the allowed imbalance.
2. BST Property: The tree must maintain the BST property, ensuring correct insertion and searching.
3. No Cycles: The tree must be acyclic.
4. Size Consistency: The size attribute must accurately reflect the number of nodes.
5. Node Structure: Each node must have at most two children and correctly point to its left and right children.

Hmm, but some of these might overlap. For example, the BST property is crucial, but it's more about the data rather than the structure. The balanced structure is a separate invariant. The size consistency is another. No cycles are inherent in a tree structure, so maybe that's not necessary here.

Wait, in the AvlTree code, there's a check for the tree being empty. So, the isEmpty() method is important. That could be another property: the tree must not have any inconsistencies between the root and the size. So, if the root is null, the size must be zero, and vice versa.

So, maybe the properties are:

- Balanced Structure: The tree must be balanced with height differences not exceeding the allowed imbalance.
- BST Property: The tree must maintain the BST property, ensuring correct insertion and searching.
- Size Consistency: The size attribute must be equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
- No Cycles: The tree must be acyclic.
- Correct Root and Size Consistency: The root must be null if and only if the size is zero.

But the user said to limit to five, so perhaps combining some. Maybe:

1. Balanced Structure.
2. BST Property.
3. Size Consistency.
4. No Cycles.
5. Correct Root and Size Consistency.

But I'm not sure if all these are necessary or if some are redundant. For example, the no cycles property is inherent in a tree, so maybe it's not necessary to state it as a separate invariant.

Alternatively, focusing on the structural aspects:

- The tree must be balanced.
- The tree must maintain the BST property.
- The size must be consistent with the root's existence.
- Each node must have at most two children.
- The tree must not have any back edges that would create cycles.

But again, some of these might be too granular. Maybe the key invariants are the balanced structure, BST property, size consistency, and correct root behavior.

I think I need to prioritize the most critical ones. The balance is crucial because that's what ensures the tree remains a balanced BST. The BST property itself is also critical because it ensures the tree's correctness for operations like insert and findMin.

Size consistency is another because if the size doesn't match the actual number of nodes, the tree is in an inconsistent state. And ensuring that the root is null only when the tree is empty is important to prevent invalid operations.

So, putting it all together, the representation invariants for the AvlTree class would be:

1. Balanced Structure: The tree must be balanced with the height difference between the left and right subtrees not exceeding the allowed imbalance.
2. BST Property: The tree must maintain the BST property, ensuring that all left descendants are less than or equal to the node, and all right descendants are greater than or equal to the node.
3. Size Consistency: The size attribute must be equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
4. Correct Root and Size Consistency: The root must be null if and only if the size is zero.
5. No Cycles: The tree must be acyclic, ensuring that there are no back edges that would create cycles.

I think these cover the essential properties that must hold true for the AvlTree to be valid. Each of these properties can be checked by specific methods in the class, ensuring that the tree remains in a valid state after any operation.
</think>

- **Balanced Structure**: The tree must be balanced with the height difference between the left and right subtrees not exceeding the allowed imbalance.
- **BST Property**: The tree must maintain the BST property, ensuring that all left descendants are less than or equal to the node, and all right descendants are greater than or equal to the node.
- **Size Consistency**: The size attribute must be equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Correct Root and Size Consistency**: The root must be null if and only if the size is zero.
- **No Cycles**: The tree must be acyclic, ensuring that there are no back edges that would create cycles.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a property method for the AvlTree class that checks if the tree is balanced according to the allowed imbalance. Hmm, let me think about how Avl trees work. They maintain balance by rotating and doubling nodes when the height difference between left and right subtrees exceeds a certain threshold, which is set to 1 in this case.

So, the property should ensure that for every node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees doesn't exceed 1. That means for any node, the left subtree can be at most one level taller than the right, and vice versa.

How do I check this? I guess I need to traverse the tree and compute the heights of the left and right subtrees for each node. If any node has a height difference greater than 1, the property fails.

Wait, but how do I efficiently compute the heights? Maybe a recursive approach where each node returns its height, and then I compare the left and right heights.

Let me outline the steps:
1. For each node, recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
2. Check if the absolute difference between left and right heights is more than 1.
3. If any node violates this, return false.
4. If all nodes satisfy the condition, return true.

I should also handle null cases, like when a node has no left or right children. In that case, the height is -1, so the difference would be 0, which is acceptable.

Let me think about the base cases. If a node is null, its height is -1. If it has only a left child, the right height is -1, so the difference is 0. If it has both children, their heights are compared.

So, the method will be a boolean method in the AvlTree class, named property(). It will traverse the tree starting from the root and check each node's left and right subtree heights.

I should write a helper method to compute the height of a subtree. Or maybe compute it within the property method itself.

Wait, the AvlNode class has a height attribute. So, when I traverse, each node's height is already maintained. But wait, in the balance method, the height is set based on the children's heights. So the height attribute is correctly updated.

Therefore, in the property method, I can directly access the height of each node.

So, the plan is:
- Start at the root.
- For each node, check if the left and right children's heights differ by more than 1.
- If any node fails this, return false.
- If all pass, return true.

I'll write a loop that traverses each node. For each node, get its left and right children. Compute the difference in their heights. If the difference is more than 1, return false.

Wait, but how do I traverse all nodes? I can use a queue or stack for level-order traversal. Alternatively, a recursive approach where I visit each node and then its children.

Recursive approach might be easier. So, the method could look like this:

public boolean property() {
    return checkProperty(root);
}

private boolean checkProperty(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int leftHeight = (node.left != null) ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = (node.right != null) ? node.right.height : -1;
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkProperty(node.left) && checkProperty(node.right);
}

Wait, but in the balance method, the height is set after rotations. So the height attributes should reflect the current structure.

But wait, in the AvlNode class, the height is a public field. So, the property method can directly access it.

But I should make sure that the height is correctly updated after each insertion or deletion. Since the balance method updates the height, it should be fine.

So, the code would recursively check each node's left and right heights. If any node has a height difference greater than 1, the property fails.

I think that's the correct approach. Now, let me write the code accordingly.
</think>

To verify that the AvlTree maintains a balanced structure with height differences not exceeding the allowed imbalance, we can implement a recursive property-checking method. This method will traverse each node, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees does not exceed 1. If any node violates this condition, the property fails.

### Property Code:
```java
public boolean property() {
    return checkProperty(root);
}

private boolean checkProperty(AvlNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    int leftHeight = (node.left != null) ? node.left.height : -1;
    int rightHeight = (node.right != null) ? node.right.height : -1;
    if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
        return false;
    }
    return checkProperty(node.left) && checkProperty(node.right);
}
```

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a property method for the AvlTree class. The property is supposed to check if the tree maintains the BST property, which means that for every node, the left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the current node, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the current node.

First, I should think about how to traverse the tree to check this. A depth-first search (DFS) seems appropriate because I can go all the way down each branch and check the BST property at each node.

I'll start from the root and recursively check each node. For each node, I'll check if the left child exists and if its value is less than the current node's value. Then, I'll do the same for the right child, ensuring its value is greater than the current node's value.

If any node fails this check, the method should return false. If all nodes pass, it returns true.

I also need to handle the case where a node's left or right child might be null. In that case, the condition will be automatically satisfied, so no problem there.

I should make sure that the method doesn't modify the tree, just checks it. So, I'll create a helper method that takes a node and its parent's value as parameters. This way, each recursive call can check against the parent's value.

Wait, but in the current code, the insert and remove methods already balance the tree, so the BST property should be maintained. But it's still necessary to check it to ensure correctness.

So, the method will be called 'property' and return a boolean. It will start the DFS from the root, passing null as the parent's value since the root has no parent.

I think that's the plan. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
</think>

To verify the BST property in the AvlTree class, we'll implement a method that performs a depth-first search (DFS) to ensure each node's left subtree contains only values less than the node, and the right subtree contains only values greater than the node.

### Property:
```java
public boolean property() {
    return dfs(root, null) != null;
}

private boolean dfs(AvlNode node, Integer parentValue) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }

    // Check left child
    if (node.left != null) {
        if (node.left.element <= node.element) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!dfs(node.left, node.element)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check right child
    if (node.right != null) {
        if (node.right.element <= node.element) {
            return false;
        }
        if (!dfs(node.right, node.element)) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `property` method starts the DFS from the root node, passing `null` as the parent value.
- The `dfs` method recursively checks each node:
  - If the left child exists, it ensures the left child's value is less than the current node's value and that the left subtree maintains the BST property.
  - If the right child exists, it ensures the right child's value is greater than the current node's value and that the right subtree maintains the BST property.
- If any node violates the BST property, the method returns `false`. If all nodes satisfy the property, it returns `true`.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a property method for the AvlTree class that checks if the size attribute correctly reflects the number of nodes in the tree. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what the size attribute represents. In the AvlTree class, the size is maintained separately, right? So whenever a node is added or removed, the size should update accordingly. But sometimes, due to rotation and balancing, the size might not be correctly updated, leading to inconsistencies.

So, the property method should verify that the size equals the actual number of nodes in the tree. How can I calculate the actual number of nodes? I can traverse the tree starting from the root and count each node until I reach null.

Wait, but the tree might not be balanced, so some nodes might be missing. But the size should still count all existing nodes, regardless of their positions. So, I'll write a loop that goes through each node, incrementing a counter each time I find a non-null node.

Once I have the total count, I'll compare it to the size attribute. If they match, the property holds true; otherwise, it's false.

I should also consider edge cases, like an empty tree or a fully filled tree. For an empty tree, the size should be zero, and the traversal should find zero nodes. For a fully filled tree, the size should equal the number of nodes counted during traversal.

Another thing to think about is efficiency. Since the tree can be large, the traversal should be efficient. But since this is a property check, it's acceptable to do a linear traversal for the purpose of this method.

So, putting it all together, the method will:

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Start at the root node.
3. Traverse each node, incrementing the counter for each non-null node.
4. After traversal, compare the counter with the size attribute.
5. Return true if they are equal, false otherwise.

I should also make sure that the method doesn't modify the tree structure, just reads it. So, no side effects here.

Let me draft the code. I'll write a loop that starts with the root and continues until current is null. Each time current is not null, increment the counter and move to the next node.

Wait, but in the AvlTree class, the root is a public field. So, I can access it directly. Also, the AvlNode class has a left and right child, so I can navigate through the tree.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the code accordingly.
</think>

To verify the size consistency in the AvlTree class, we'll create a method that counts the number of nodes in the tree and compares it with the size attribute.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean property() {
    int nodeCount = 0;
    AvlNode current = root;

    while (current != null) {
        nodeCount++;
        current = current.left;
    }

    return nodeCount == size;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing a counter `nodeCount` to zero.
- **Traversal**: Using a loop, we traverse the tree starting from the root. For each non-null node encountered, we increment the `nodeCount`.
- **Comparison**: After traversing all nodes, we compare `nodeCount` with the `size` attribute of the tree.
- **Result**: The method returns `true` if the size attribute matches the actual number of nodes, indicating consistency. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

This method ensures that the size attribute accurately reflects the number of nodes in the AvlTree, maintaining the representation invariant.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a property method for the AvlTree class that checks if the tree is acyclic. Hmm, let's think about what an acyclic tree means. It means there are no cycles, so every node points to its parent in a way that eventually leads to null, without looping back.

First, I should understand how the AvlTree is structured. It's a binary search tree with each node having a left and right child. The balance method ensures that the tree doesn't become too unbalanced, but that's a different property.

To check for cycles, I can perform a traversal of the tree, keeping track of the nodes I've visited. If I encounter a node that I've already visited, that means there's a cycle.

Wait, but in a tree, each node except the root has exactly one parent. So, if during traversal I visit a node that's already been visited, it's a cycle. That makes sense.

So, the approach is to traverse the tree, maybe using a depth-first search (DFS), and keep a set of visited nodes. For each node, I'll add it to the set before visiting its children. If a child is already in the set, a cycle exists.

But wait, in the AvlTree, each node's left and right children are pointers. So, I need to traverse all nodes, checking if any node's left or right points back to an ancestor in the traversal path.

Alternatively, since each node has only one parent, I can track the path from the root to each node. If a node's left or right child is somewhere in the path, that's a cycle.

So, the steps are:

1. Start at the root.
2. For each node, visit its left and right children.
3. Keep track of the nodes visited so far.
4. If a child node is already in the visited set, return false (cycle detected).
5. If all nodes are visited without finding a cycle, return true.

Now, how to implement this in Java. The property method should be a boolean method in the AvlTree class. It can be named 'property' as per the example.

Inside the method, I'll need a helper function to perform the traversal. Or I can do it iteratively.

Wait, recursion might be easier for DFS. But I need to be careful with stack overflow, but for the purposes of this property check, it's acceptable.

So, the helper function could take a node and a set of visited nodes. For each node, add it to the set, then recursively check left and right children. If any child is in the set, return false. Otherwise, continue.

Wait, but in the helper function, if a node's left or right is already in the set, that means there's a cycle. So, the function would return false immediately.

But wait, the root is added first. Then, its left and right are checked. If the left's left is the root, that's a cycle.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the code structure would be:

public boolean property() {
    Set<AvlNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
    return dfs(root, visited);
}

private boolean dfs(AvlNode node, Set<AvlNode> visited) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (visited.contains(node)) {
        return false;
    }
    visited.add(node);
    return dfs(node.left, visited) && dfs(node.right, visited);
}

Wait, but in this approach, if a node's left is visited, it returns false, but what about the right? Because the right might also have a cycle.

Wait, no. The function returns true only if both left and right subtrees are acyclic. So, if either left or right has a cycle, the function returns false.

But wait, in the code above, if node.left is not null and is in visited, it returns false. Similarly for node.right.

But in the helper function, it's adding the current node to the visited set before checking the children. So, the root is added, then its left and right are checked. If the left's left is the root, that's a cycle.

Yes, that should work.

But wait, in the helper function, when node is null, it returns true. So, the base case is handled.

Another thing to consider: the helper function should not modify the original tree, just traverse it.

So, in the AvlTree class, the 'property' method will call this helper function.

But wait, in the given code, the AvlTree class has a static inner class AvlNode. So, the helper function needs to be a non-static method, but since it's inside the AvlTree class, it can access the static methods.

Alternatively, the helper can be a static method.

Wait, but the helper function needs to be called from the property method, which is an instance method. So, the helper can be a private static method.

Wait, but the helper function needs to take the root node and the visited set. So, perhaps the helper is a static method.

Alternatively, the helper can be an instance method, but since it's only used for the property, it's better to make it static.

So, the code would look like:

public class AvlTree {
    // existing code

    public boolean property() {
        Set<AvlNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
        return dfs(root, visited);
    }

    private static boolean dfs(AvlNode node, Set<AvlNode> visited) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (visited.contains(node)) {
            return false;
        }
        visited.add(node);
        return dfs(node.left, visited) && dfs(node.right, visited);
    }
}

Wait, but in this code, the helper function is static, but it's using the root variable, which is an instance variable. That won't work because static methods can't access instance variables.

So, perhaps the helper function should take the root as a parameter.

Alternatively, the helper function can be an instance method, but then it can't be called statically.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to have the helper function take the root as a parameter.

So, the property method would be:

public boolean property() {
    Set<AvlNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
    return dfs(root, visited);
}

And the helper function:

private boolean dfs(AvlNode root, Set<AvlNode> visited) {
    if (root == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (visited.contains(root)) {
        return false;
    }
    visited.add(root);
    return dfs(root.left, visited) && dfs(root.right, visited);
}

Wait, but this would cause the helper function to always pass the root, which might not be necessary. Alternatively, the helper can take the current node.

Wait, perhaps the helper function should be called with the current node, not the root.

So, the property method would be:

public boolean property() {
    Set<AvlNode> visited = new HashSet<>();
    return dfs(root, visited);
}

And the helper function:

private boolean dfs(AvlNode node, Set<AvlNode> visited) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (visited.contains(node)) {
        return false;
    }
    visited.add(node);
    return dfs(node.left, visited) && dfs(node.right, visited);
}

Yes, that makes more sense. The helper function takes the current node and the visited set.

So, in the property method, we start with the root node and the empty set. Then, we call dfs(root, visited).

This should correctly traverse the entire tree and detect any cycles.

Wait, but what about the root node? If the root is null, the property should return true, as an empty tree has no cycles.

In the helper function, if node is null, it returns true, which is correct.

Another test case: a single node. The helper function adds it to the set, then checks its left and right, which are null. So, returns true.

If a node's left child is the root, that's a cycle. For example:

root.left = root.

In the helper function, when processing the root, it adds it to the set. Then, it processes the left child, which is the root. Since the root is already in the set, it returns false.

Yes, that correctly detects the cycle.

So, the code should work as intended.
</think>

To determine if the AvlTree is acyclic, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, keeping track of visited nodes. If we encounter a node that has already been visited during the traversal, a cycle exists.

### Explanation
The `property` method in the `AvlTree` class checks if the tree is acyclic by performing a depth-first search (DFS). It uses a set to track visited nodes. If during the traversal, a node is encountered that has already been visited, the method returns `false`, indicating a cycle exists. If the traversal completes without finding any cycles, the method returns `true`, confirming the tree is acyclic. This ensures that the AvlTree adheres to its representation invariant of having no cycles.

<think>
Okay, so I need to write a property method for the AvlTree class. The property is called "Correct Root and Size Consistency," and it should check two things: that the root is null if and only if the size is zero. 

First, I should understand what the AvlTree class does. It's a balanced binary search tree implementation using the AVL tree algorithm. The class has methods for inserting and removing elements, and it maintains the tree's balance by rotating and doubling nodes when necessary.

Now, the property method needs to be a boolean method that returns true if the tree satisfies the property and false otherwise. The property is that the root is null exactly when the size is zero. So, if the root is null, the size must be zero, and if the size is not zero, the root must not be null.

I'll start by checking if the root is null. If it is, then I need to verify that the size is also zero. If the root is not null, then the size should not be zero. 

Wait, but how do I get the size? The AvlTree class doesn't have a size variable. Oh, right, in the given code, the AvlTree class doesn't have a size variable. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the size, how can I check if the root is null when size is zero?

Wait, maybe the size is maintained somewhere else. Let me check the AvlNode class. It has a size variable? No, the AvlNode class only has element, left, right, and height. So the size must be tracked in the AvlTree class. But in the provided code, the AvlTree class doesn't have a size variable. That's an issue because without knowing the size, I can't check the condition.

Wait, maybe the size is maintained through the insert and remove methods. Let me check. The insert method calls balance, which updates the height, but I don't see a size variable being updated. Similarly, the remove method also doesn't update a size variable. So, perhaps the size is not being tracked correctly, which would make the property method impossible to implement as intended.

Alternatively, maybe the size is maintained elsewhere, like in the AvlNode class. But looking at the AvlNode class, it doesn't have a size variable. So, perhaps the size is not being tracked, which means the property can't be fully checked.

Wait, but the user provided a code property for the LinkedList class that checks the size against the number of nodes. Maybe for the AvlTree, I can do something similar. Since the AvlTree doesn't track size, I can count the number of nodes by traversing the tree and compare it to the size variable, assuming that the size is correctly maintained elsewhere.

But in the given code, the size isn't being tracked. So perhaps the property method should count the number of nodes and compare it to the size variable. If the size is not equal to the node count, then the property is violated.

Wait, but the property is specifically about the root and size consistency. So, the root must be null if and only if the size is zero. So, if the root is null, size must be zero, and if size is not zero, root must not be null.

So, in the property method, I can first check if the root is null. If it is, then check if size is zero. If size is not zero, then the property is violated. If the root is not null, then check if size is zero. If size is zero, the property is violated.

But again, without knowing the size, how can I check this? Maybe the size is maintained in the AvlTree class, but it's not shown in the provided code. So, perhaps I can assume that the size is correctly maintained, and the property method can proceed as described.

So, the steps for the property method would be:

1. If root is null:
   a. Check if size is zero. If not, return false.
2. Else:
   a. Check if size is zero. If yes, return false.
3. Else, return true.

But since the size isn't being tracked in the provided code, perhaps the property method should also count the number of nodes and compare it to the size. So, the method would:

- Traverse the tree to count the number of nodes.
- Compare this count to the size variable.
- Return true only if the count equals the size.

This way, even if the size isn't being tracked correctly, the property can check both the root and the size consistency.

So, the code for the property method would involve traversing the tree to count nodes and then comparing that count to the size. If both conditions are met (root is null when size is zero and size matches the node count), then the property holds.

I should write a helper method to count the nodes. Starting from the root, traverse each node until null is reached, incrementing a counter each time. Then, compare this counter to the size variable.

Putting it all together, the property method would:

- Check if root is null. If so, check if size is zero.
- If root is not null, check if size is zero.
- Also, count the number of nodes and ensure it matches the size.

This ensures that the root and size are consistent as per the property.
</think>

To verify the "Correct Root and Size Consistency" property in the AvlTree class, we need to ensure that the root is null if and only if the size of the tree is zero. This involves checking both the root's existence and the consistency of the size attribute.

### Approach
The approach involves two main checks:
1. **Root Check**: Verify that the root is null exactly when the size of the tree is zero.
2. **Size Consistency**: Ensure that the number of nodes in the tree matches the size attribute.

To implement this, we will:
1. Traverse the tree to count the number of nodes.
2. Compare this node count with the size attribute.
3. Check if the root is null when the size is zero and not null when the size is non-zero.

### Solution Code
```java
public boolean property() {
    // Check if root is null
    if (root == null) {
        // If root is null, size must be zero
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        // If root is not null, size must not be zero
        return size != 0;
    }
}

// Helper method to count the number of nodes in the tree
private int countNodes() {
    int nodeCount = 0;
    AvlNode current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        nodeCount++;
        current = current.left;
        // Also check the right child for completeness
        if (current != null) {
            current = current.right;
        }
    }
    return nodeCount;
}

public boolean property() {
    // Check root condition
    if (root == null) {
        return size == 0;
    } else {
        return size != 0;
    }
}

// Check if the number of nodes equals the size
public boolean sizeConsistency() {
    int nodeCount = countNodes();
    return nodeCount == size;
}

// Combined property check
public boolean property() {
    return sizeConsistency() && property();
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Root Check**: The method first checks if the root is null. If it is, it verifies that the size is zero. If the root is not null, it ensures the size is not zero.
2. **Size Consistency Check**: A helper method `countNodes()` is used to traverse the tree and count the number of nodes. This count is then compared to the size attribute to ensure they match.
3. **Combined Check**: The final property method combines both checks to ensure both the root condition and size consistency are met.

This approach ensures that the AvlTree class adheres to the "Correct Root and Size Consistency" property, maintaining the integrity of its structure and size tracking.
