To write the `repOK` method for the `HashMap` class, we need to ensure that the internal state of the `HashMap` satisfies all the necessary conditions that define its representation. Here are the key conditions that need to be checked:

1. **Capacity and Threshold**: The capacity should be a power of 2, and the threshold should be calculated correctly based on the capacity and load factor.
2. **Table Initialization**: The table should be initialized with the correct capacity, and all entries should be `null` initially.
3. **Size Consistency**: The size of the `HashMap` should be consistent with the number of non-null entries in the table.
4. **ModCount Consistency**: The `modCount` should be consistent with the number of modifications made to the `HashMap`.
5. **Entry Consistency**: Each entry in the table should have a valid hash, key, value, and next pointer.

Here is the `repOK` method for the `HashMap` class:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if capacity is a power of 2
    if ((table.length & (table.length - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if threshold is calculated correctly
    if (threshold != (int) (table.length * loadFactor)) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if table is initialized correctly
    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        if (table[i] != null) {
            Entry e = table[i];
            while (e != null) {
                // Check if each entry has a valid hash, key, value, and next pointer
                if (e.hash < 0 || e.key == null || e.value == null) {
                    return false;
                }
                e = e.next;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if size is consistent with the number of non-null entries in the table
    int actualSize = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            actualSize++;
            e = e.next;
        }
    }
    if (actualSize != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if modCount is consistent with the number of modifications
    // This is a more complex check and typically requires tracking modifications
    // For simplicity, we assume modCount is consistent with the number of modifications

    return true;
}
```

This `repOK` method checks the basic invariants of the `HashMap` class. Note that the `modCount` consistency check is simplified and assumes that the `modCount` is consistent with the number of modifications. In a real-world scenario, you might need to track modifications more precisely to ensure `modCount` is accurate.
