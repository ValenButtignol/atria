Here's a representation invariant for the `BinTree` class, expressed as a method called `repOK`:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the root is null, and if so, the size is 0
    if (root == null && size != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the root is not null, and if so, the size is greater than 0
    if (root != null && size == 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the size is correct based on the number of nodes in the tree
    if (size != countNodes(root)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the tree is a valid binary tree (i.e., each node has at most two children)
    return isValidBinaryTree(root);
}

private int countNodes(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1 + countNodes(node.left) + countNodes(node.right);
    }
}

private boolean isValidBinaryTree(Node node) {
    if (node == null) {
        return true;
    }
    
    if (node.left != null && node.right != null) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return isValidBinaryTree(node.left) && isValidBinaryTree(node.right);
}
```

In this representation invariant, we check the following conditions:

1. If the root is null, then the size is 0.
2. If the root is not null, then the size is greater than 0.
3. The size is correct based on the number of nodes in the tree (i.e., the size is equal to the number of nodes in the tree).
4. The tree is a valid binary tree (i.e., each node has at most two children).

If all these conditions are met, then the representation invariant `repOK` returns true, indicating that the object is in a valid state. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the object is in an invalid state.
