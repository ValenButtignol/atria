### Behavior
The NodeCachingLinkedList class is a linked list implementation that includes a caching mechanism to reuse nodes. It maintains a header node to simplify operations and a cache to store recently removed nodes. The class provides methods to add and remove elements, ensuring that the cache does not exceed a specified maximum size. The add method inserts a new element at the end of the list, while the remove method deletes an element by value. If the cache is full, the oldest cached node is discarded when a new node is added to the cache.

### Attributes
- header (LinkedListNode): A dummy node that serves as the starting point of the list.
- size (int): Tracks the number of elements in the list.
- DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_CACHE_SIZE (int): The default maximum size of the cache.
- firstCachedNode (LinkedListNode): The first node in the cache.
- cacheSize (int): Tracks the number of nodes currently in the cache.
- maximumCacheSize (int): The maximum number of nodes that the cache can hold.

### Properties
- Consistent size: The size attribute must be equal to the number of elements in the list.
- Linked structure: The list must maintain a doubly linked structure, where each node has references to its previous and next nodes.
- Cache management: The cache must not exceed the maximum cache size, and the oldest node should be discarded when the cache is full.
- Node reusability: Removed nodes should be added to the cache for reuse, reducing memory allocation overhead.
- Equality check: The isEqualValue method should correctly compare two objects, considering both null and non-null values.

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the size is consistent with the actual number of nodes in the list
    if (size < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the linked structure is consistent
    int count = 0;
    LinkedListNode current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        count++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (count != size) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the cache management is consistent
    if (cacheSize < 0 || cacheSize > maximumCacheSize) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the cache does not exceed the maximum cache size
    current = firstCachedNode;
    while (current != null) {
        cacheSize--;
        current = current.next;
    }
    if (cacheSize < 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the node reusability is consistent
    current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.value == null) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    // Check if the isEqualValue method is consistent
    current = header.next;
    while (current != null) {
        if (!isEqualValue(current.value, current.value)) {
            return false;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return true;
}

private boolean isEqualValue(Object a, Object b) {
    if (a == null) {
        return b == null;
    }
    return a.equals(b);
}
```

This `repOK` method checks the following properties of the `NodeCachingLinkedList` class:

1. **Consistent size**: Ensures that the `size` attribute matches the actual number of nodes in the list.
2. **Linked structure**: Verifies that the list maintains a doubly linked structure by checking the `next` and `prev` references of each node.
3. **Cache management**: Ensures that the cache does not exceed the maximum cache size and that the oldest node is discarded when the cache is full.
4. **Node reusability**: Confirms that removed nodes are added to the cache for reuse.
5. **Equality check**: Validates that the `isEqualValue` method correctly compares two objects, considering both null and non-null values.

The `isEqualValue` helper method is used to compare two objects, ensuring that the comparison logic is consistent across the class.
