The HashMap class is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in a hash table. It provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving entries, as well as resizing the table when it becomes too full.

Attributes:

- table: an array of Entry objects that stores the key-value pairs
- size: the number of entries in the map
- threshold: the maximum number of entries allowed in the map before resizing
- loadFactor: the ratio of the number of entries to the table size
- modCount: a counter for the number of modifications made to the map

Methods:

- HashMap(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor): constructs a new HashMap with the specified initial capacity and load factor
- HashMap(int initialCapacity): constructs a new HashMap with the specified initial capacity and the default load factor
- HashMap(): constructs a new HashMap with the default initial capacity and load factor
- size(): returns the number of entries in the map
- isEmpty(): returns true if the map is empty
- get(Object key): returns the value associated with the specified key, or null if the key is not in the map
- put(Object key, Object value): adds a new entry to the map or updates the value associated with the specified key
- remove(Object key): removes the entry associated with the specified key and returns its value
- clear(): removes all entries from the map
- resize(int newCapacity): resizes the table to the specified capacity
- transfer(Entry[] newTable): transfers the entries from the old table to the new table

Constraints:

- The initial capacity must be a positive integer
- The load factor must be a positive float
- The table size must be a power of 2
- The threshold must be a multiple of the load factor
- The modCount must be incremented whenever the map is modified

Purpose:

- The HashMap class provides a data structure for storing and retrieving key-value pairs efficiently
- It is designed to handle a large number of entries and to resize the table automatically when it becomes too full
- It provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving entries, as well as resizing the table and clearing the map.

Here is the representation invariant for the HashMap class as a Java method called `repOK`:

```java
public boolean repOK() {
    // Check if the table size is a power of 2
    if ((table.length & (table.length - 1)) != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the threshold is a multiple of the load factor
    if (threshold % loadFactor != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the modCount is incremented correctly
    if (modCount != size + table.length) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if all entries in the table are valid
    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            if (e.hash == Integer.MIN_VALUE || e.hash == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                return false;
            }
            if (e.key == null && e.hash != 0) {
                return false;
            }
            e = e.next;
        }
    }

    // Check if the size is correct
    if (size != countEntries()) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

private int countEntries() {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < table.length; i++) {
        Entry e = table[i];
        while (e != null) {
            count++;
            e = e.next;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This method checks the following invariants:

1. The table size is a power of 2.
2. The threshold is a multiple of the load factor.
3. The modCount is incremented correctly.
4. All entries in the table are valid (i.e., their hash codes are not Integer.MIN_VALUE or Integer.MAX_VALUE, and their keys are not null unless their hash codes are 0).
5. The size is correct (i.e., it matches the number of entries in the table).

If any of these invariants are not met, the method returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
